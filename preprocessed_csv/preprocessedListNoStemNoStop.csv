"AGPL-1.0","affero general public license version 1 march 2002 copyright © 2002 affero inc 510 third street suite 225 san francisco ca 94107 usa this license is a modified version of the gnu general public license copyright copyright 1989 1991 free software foundation inc made with their permission section 2 d has been added to cover use of software over a computer network everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the affero general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this public license applies to most of affero s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it some other affero software is covered by the gnu library general public license instead you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price this general public license is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that you have you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with two steps 1 copyright the software and 2 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software also for each author s protection and ours we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software if the software is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations finally any free program is threatened constantly by software patents we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses in effect making the program proprietary to prevent this we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone s free use or not licensed at all the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0 this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this affero general public license the program below refers to any such program or work and a work based on the program means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification each licensee is addressed as you activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running the program is not restricted and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program independent of having been made by running the program whether that is true depends on what the program does 1 you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee 2 you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the program and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change b you must cause any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license c if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this license exception if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement d if the program as you received it is intended to interact with users through a computer network and if in the version you received any user interacting with the program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that user of the program s complete source code you must not remove that facility from your modified version of the program or work based on the program and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with your program through a computer network to request immediate transmission by http of the complete source code of your modified version or other derivative work these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license 3 you may copy and distribute the program or a work based on it under section 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following a accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or b accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or c accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer in accord with subsection b above the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code 4 you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense or distribute the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance 5 you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the program or any work based on the program you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the program or works based on it 6 each time you redistribute the program or any work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license 7 if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the

kaitim gb gb character set which are originally distributed by arphic and the derivatives of those fonts created through any modification including modifying glyph reordering glyph converting format changing font name or adding deleting some characters in from glyph table pl means public license copyright holder means whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the font you means the licensee or person copying redistributing or modifying the font freely available means that you have the freedom to copy or modify the font as well as redistribute copies of the font under the same conditions you received not price if you wish you can charge for this service 1 copying distribution you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this font in any medium without restriction provided that you retain this license file arphicpl txt unaltered in all copies 2 modification you may otherwise modify your copy of this font in any way including modifying glyph reordering glyph converting format changing font name or adding deleting some characters in from glyph table and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of section 1 above provided that the following conditions are met a you must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating how and when you changed that file b you must make such modifications freely available as a whole to all third parties under the terms of this license such as by offering access to copy the modifications from a designated place or distributing the modifications on a medium customarily used for software interchange c if the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the font under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this license these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the font and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works therefore mere aggregation of another work not based on the font with the font on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license 3 condition subsequent you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute

court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the font at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the font by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the font if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances 7 no warranty because the font is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the font to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders or other parties provide the font as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the font is with you should the font prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 8 damages waiver unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing in no event will any copyrightt holders or other parties who may copy modify or redistribute the font as permitted above be liable to you for any direct indirect

to unidentified software the afl contains a complete copyright grant to the software the bsd and apache licenses are vague and incomplete in that respect the afl contains a complete patent grant to the software the bsd mit uoi ncsa and apache licenses rely on an implied patent license and contain no explicit patent grant the afl makes it clear that no trademark rights are granted to the licensor

"AGPL-3.0","gnu affero general public license version 3 19 november 2007 copyright copyright 2007 free software foundation inc http fsf org everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the gnu affero general public license is a free copyleft license for software and other kinds of works specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software the licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works by contrast our general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for them if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things developers that use our general public licenses protect your rights with two steps 1 assert copyright on the software and 2 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software a secondary benefit of defending all users freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program if they receive widespread use become available for other developers to incorporate many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation however in the case of software used on network servers this result may fail to come about the gnu general public license permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public the gnu affero general public license is designed specifically to ensure that in such cases the modified source code becomes available to the community it requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server therefore public use of a modified version on a publicly accessible server gives the public access to the source code of the modified version an older license called the affero general public license and published by affero was designed to accomplish similar goals this is a different license not a version of the affero gpl but affero has released a new version of the affero gpl which permits relicensing under this license the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions 0 definitions this license refers to version 3 of the gnu affero general public license copyright also means copyright like laws that apply to other kinds of works such as semiconductor masks the program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this license each licensee is addressed as you licensees and recipients may be individuals or organizations to modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an exact copy the resulting work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work based on the earlier work a covered work means either the unmodified program or a work based on the program to propagate a work means to do anything with it that without permission would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy propagation includes copying distribution with or without modification making available to the public and in some countries other activities as well to convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies mere interaction with a user through a computer network with no transfer of a copy is not conveying an interactive user interface displays appropriate legal notices to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that 1 displays an appropriate copyright notice and 2 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work except to the extent that warranties are provided that licensees may convey the work under this license and how to view a copy of this license if the interface presents a list of user commands or options such as a menu a prominent item in the list meets this criterion 1 source code the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it object code means any non source form of a work a standard interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body or in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language one that is widely used among developers working in that language the system libraries of an executable work include anything other than the work as a whole that a is included in the normal form of packaging a major component but which is not part of that major component and b serves only to enable use of the work with that major component or to implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form a major component in this context means a major essential component kernel window system and so on of the specific operating system if any on which the executable work runs or a compiler used to produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it the corresponding source for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate install and for an executable work run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to control those activities however it does not include the work s system libraries or general purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work for example corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work 2 basic permissions all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of copyright on the program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program the output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the output given its content constitutes a covered work this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent as provided by copyright law you may make run and propagate covered works that you do not convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force you may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you or provide you with facilities for running those works provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf under your direction and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below sublicensing is not allowed section 10 makes it unnecessary 3 protecting users legal rights from anti circumvention law no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on 20 december 1996 or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures when you convey a covered work you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing against the work s users your or third parties legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures 4 conveying verbatim copies you may convey verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice keep intact all notices stating that this license and any non permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the program you may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee 5 conveying modified source versions you may convey a work based on the program or the modifications to produce it from the program in the form of source code under the terms of section 4 provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving a relevant date b the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section 7 this requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to keep intact all notices c you must license the entire work as a whole under this license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy this license will therefore apply along with any applicable section 7 additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts regardless of how they are packaged this license gives no permission to license the work in any other way but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it d if the work has interactive user interfaces each must display appropriate legal notices however if the program has interactive interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices your work need not make them do so a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation s users beyond what the individual works permit inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate 6 conveying non source forms you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5 provided that you also convey the machine readable corresponding source under the terms of this license in one of these ways a convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange b convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by a written offer valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model to give anyone who possesses the object code either 1 a copy of the corresponding source for all the software in the product that is covered by this license on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source or 2 access to copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge c convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord with subsection 6b d convey the object code by offering access from a designated place gratis or for a charge and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no further charge you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code if the place to copy the object code is a network server the corresponding source may be on a different server operated by you or a third party that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements e convey the object code using peer to peer transmission provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d a separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source as a system library need not be included in conveying the object code work a user product is either 1 a consumer product which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal family or household purposes or 2 anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling in determining whether a product is a consumer product doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage for a particular product received by a particular user normally used refers to a typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product a product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial industrial or non consumer uses unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product installation information for a user product means any methods procedures authorization keys or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from a modified version of its corresponding source the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made if you convey an object code work under this section in or with or specifically for use in a user product and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term regardless of how the transaction is characterized the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product for example the work has been installed in rom the requirement to provide installation information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or for the user product in which it has been modified or installed access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network corresponding source conveyed and installation information provided in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented and with an implementation available to the public in source code form and must require no special password or key for unpacking reading or copying 7 additional terms additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated as though they were included in this license to the extent that they are valid under applicable law if additional permissions apply only to part of the program that part may be used separately under those permissions but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions when you convey a copy of a covered work you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of it additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work you may place additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission notwithstanding any other provision of this license for material you add to a covered work you may if authorized by the copyright holders of that material supplement the terms of this license with terms a disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this license or b requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal notices displayed by works containing it or c prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version or d limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material or e declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names trademarks or service marks or f requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material or modified versions of it with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors all other non permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within the meaning of section 10 if the program as you received it or any part of it contains a notice stating that it is governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction you may remove that term if a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section you must place in the relevant source files a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms additional terms permissive or non permissive may be stated in the form of a separately written license or stated as exceptions the above requirements apply either way 8 termination you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11 however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license for any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10 9 acceptance not required for having copies you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a copy of the program ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer to peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance however nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or propagating a covered work you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so 10 automatic licensing of downstream recipients each time you convey a covered work the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run modify and propagate that work subject to this license you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license an entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an organization or substantially all assets of one or subdividing an organization or merging organizations if propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license for example you may not impose a license fee royalty or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this license and you may not initiate litigation including a cross claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making using selling offering for sale or importing the program or any portion of it 11 patents a contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or a work on which the program is based the work thus licensed is called the contributor s contributor version a contributor s essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor whether already acquired or hereafter acquired that would be infringed by some manner permitted by this license of making using or selling its contributor version but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version for purposes of this definition control includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license each contributor grants you a non exclusive worldwide royalty free patent license under the contributor s essential patent claims to make use sell offer for sale import and otherwise run modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version in the following three paragraphs a patent license is any express agreement or commitment however denominated not to enforce a patent such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement to grant such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party if you convey a covered work knowingly relying on a patent license and the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy free of charge and under the terms of this license through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means then you must either 1 cause the corresponding source to be so available or 2 arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work or 3 arrange in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license to extend the patent license to downstream recipients knowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that but for the patent license your conveying the covered work in a country or your recipient s use of the covered work in a country would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid if pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of a covered work and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use propagate modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it a patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of its coverage prohibits the exercise of or is conditioned on the non exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license you may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work and under which the third party grants to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you a discriminatory patent license a in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you or copies made from those copies or b primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work unless you entered into that arrangement or that patent license was granted prior to 28 march 2007 nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law 12 no surrender of others freedom if conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not convey it at all for example if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the program the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program 13 remote network interaction use with the gnu general public license notwithstanding any other provision of this license if you modify the program your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network if your version supports such interaction an opportunity to receive the corresponding source of your version by providing access to the corresponding source from a network server at no charge through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software this corresponding source shall include the corresponding source for any work covered by version 3 of the gnu general public license that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the gnu general public license into a single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the gnu general public license 14 revised versions of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the gnu affero general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies that a certain numbered version of the gnu affero general public license or any later version applies to it you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of the gnu affero general public license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu affero general public license can be used that proxy s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the program later license versions may give you additional or different permissions however no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version 15 disclaimer of warranty there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 16 limitation of liability in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who modifies and or conveys the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages 17 interpretation of sections 15 and 16 if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above can not be given local legal effect according to their terms reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does copyright copyright year name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu affero general public license as published by the free software foundation either version 3 of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu affero general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu affero general public license along with this program if not see http www gnu org licenses also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail if your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source for example if your program is a web application its interface could display a source link that leads users to an archive of the code there are many ways you could offer source and different solutions will be better for different programs see section 13 for the specific requirements you should also get your employer if you work as a programmer or school if any to sign a copyright disclaimer for the program if necessary for more information on this and how to apply and follow the gnu agpl see http www gnu org licenses"

source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of a such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that you have you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must tell them their rights we protect your rights with two steps 1 copyright the software and 2 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to

these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this general public license d you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty

modify sublicense distribute or transfer the program except as expressly provided under this general public license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense distribute or transfer the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights to use the program under this license however parties who have received copies or rights to use copies from you under this general public license

"LGPL-2.0+","gnu library general public license version 2 june 1991 copyright copyright 1991 free software foundation inc 51 franklin st fifth floor boston ma 02110 1301 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed this is the first released version of the library gpl it is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary gpl preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this license the library general public license applies to some specially designated free software foundation software and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it you can use it for your libraries too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of the library whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code if you link a program with the library you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it and you must show them these terms so they know their rights our method of protecting your rights has two steps 1 copyright the library and 2 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the library also for each distributor s protection we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library if the library is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations finally any free program is threatened constantly by software patents we wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software to prevent this we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone s free use or not licensed at all most gnu software including some libraries is covered by the ordinary gnu general public license which was designed for utility programs this license the gnu library general public license applies to certain designated libraries this license is quite different from the ordinary one be sure to read it in full and don t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license the reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it linking a program with a library without changing the library is in some sense simply using the library and is analogous to running a utility program or application program however in a textual and legal sense the linked executable is a combined work a derivative of the original library and the ordinary general public license treats it as such because of this blurred distinction using the ordinary general public license for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing because most developers did not use the libraries we concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better however unrestricted linking of non free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves this library general public license is intended to permit developers of non free programs to use free libraries while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them we have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the library the hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow pay close attention to the difference between a work based on the library and a work that uses the library the former contains code derived from the library while the latter only works together with the library note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary general public license rather than by this special one terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0 this license agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this library general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions and or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does 1 you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library s complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee 2 you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the modified work must itself be a software library b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well defined independent of the application therefore subsection 2d requires that any application supplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license 3 you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version 2 instead of to this license if a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library 4 you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code 5 a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section 6 otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section 6 any executables containing that work also fall under section 6 whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself 6 as an exception to the sections above you may also compile or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine readable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections 1 and 2 above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machine readable work that uses the library as object code and or source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions b accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection 6a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution c if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place d verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you can not use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute 7 you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work 8 you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance 9 you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it 10 each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license 11 if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license 12 if the distribution and or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license 13 the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the library general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation 14 if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of

"GPL-3.0+","gnu general public license version 3 29 june 2007 copyright © 2007 free software foundation inc http fsf org everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the gnu general public license is a free copyleft license for software and other kinds of works the licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users we the free software foundation use the gnu general public license for most of our software it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for them if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights therefore you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it responsibilities to respect the freedom of others for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights developers that use the gnu gpl protect your rights with two steps 1 assert copyright on the software and 2 offer you this license giving you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify it for the developers and authors protection the gpl clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software for both users and authors sake the gpl requires that modified versions be marked as changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them although the manufacturer can do so this is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users freedom to change the software the systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use which is precisely where it is most unacceptable therefore we have designed this version of the gpl to prohibit the practice for those products if such problems arise substantially in other domains we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the gpl as needed to protect the freedom of users finally every program is threatened constantly by software patents states should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general purpose computers but in those that do we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary to prevent this the gpl assures that patents can not be used to render the program non free the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions 0 definitions “ this license ” refers to version 3 of the gnu general public license “ copyright ” also means copyright like laws that apply to other kinds of works such as semiconductor masks “ the program ” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this license each licensee is addressed as “ you ” “ licensees ” and “ recipients ” may be individuals or organizations to “ modify ” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an exact copy the resulting work is called a “ modified version ” of the earlier work or a work “ based on ” the earlier work a “ covered work ” means either the unmodified program or a work based on the program to “ propagate ” a work means to do anything with it that without permission would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy propagation includes copying distribution with or without modification making available to the public and in some countries other activities as well to “ convey ” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies mere interaction with a user through a computer network with no transfer of a copy is not conveying an interactive user interface displays “ appropriate legal notices ” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that 1 displays an appropriate copyright notice and 2 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work except to the extent that warranties are provided that licensees may convey the work under this license and how to view a copy of this license if the interface presents a list of user commands or options such as a menu a prominent item in the list meets this criterion 1 source code the “ source code ” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it “ object code ” means any non source form of a work a “ standard interface ” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body or in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language one that is widely used among developers working in that language the “ system libraries ” of an executable work include anything other than the work as a whole that a is included in the normal form of packaging a major component but which is not part of that major component and b serves only to enable use of the work with that major component or to implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form a “ major component ” in this context means a major essential component kernel window system and so on of the specific operating system if any on which the executable work runs or a compiler used to produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it the “ corresponding source ” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate install and for an executable work run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to control those activities however it does not include the work s system libraries or general purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work for example corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work 2 basic permissions all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of copyright on the program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program the output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the output given its content constitutes a covered work this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent as provided by copyright law you may make run and propagate covered works that you do not convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force you may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you or provide you with facilities for running those works provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf under your direction and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below sublicensing is not allowed section 10 makes it unnecessary 3 protecting users legal rights from anti circumvention law no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on 20 december 1996 or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures when you convey a covered work you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing against the work s users your or third parties legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures 4 conveying verbatim copies you may convey verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice keep intact all notices stating that this license and any non permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the program you may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee 5 conveying modified source versions you may convey a work based on the program or the modifications to produce it from the program in the form of source code under the terms of section 4 provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving a relevant date b the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section 7 this requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “ keep intact all notices ” c you must license the entire work as a whole under this license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy this license will therefore apply along with any applicable section 7 additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts regardless of how they are packaged this license gives no permission to license the work in any other way but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it d if the work has interactive user interfaces each must display appropriate legal notices however if the program has interactive interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices your work need not make them do so a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an “ aggregate ” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation s users beyond what the individual works permit inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate 6 conveying non source forms you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5 provided that you also convey the machine readable corresponding source under the terms of this license in one of these ways a convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange b convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by a written offer valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model to give anyone who possesses the object code either 1 a copy of the corresponding source for all the software in the product that is covered by this license on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source or 2 access to copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge c convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord with subsection 6b d convey the object code by offering access from a designated place gratis or for a charge and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no further charge you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code if the place to copy the object code is a network server the corresponding source may be on a different server operated by you or a third party that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements e convey the object code using peer to peer transmission provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d a separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source as a system library need not be included in conveying the object code work a “ user product ” is either 1 a “ consumer product ” which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal family or household purposes or 2 anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling in determining whether a product is a consumer product doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage for a particular product received by a particular user “ normally used ” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product a product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial industrial or non consumer uses unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product “ installation information ” for a user product means any methods procedures authorization keys or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from a modified version of its corresponding source the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made if you convey an object code work under this section in or with or specifically for use in a user product and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term regardless of how the transaction is characterized the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product for example the work has been installed in rom the requirement to provide installation information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or for the user product in which it has been modified or installed access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network corresponding source conveyed and installation information provided in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented and with an implementation available to the public in source code form and must require no special password or key for unpacking reading or copying 7 additional terms “ additional permissions ” are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated as though they were included in this license to the extent that they are valid under applicable law if additional permissions apply only to part of the program that part may be used separately under those permissions but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions when you convey a copy of a covered work you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of it additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work you may place additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission notwithstanding any other provision of this license for material you add to a covered work you may if authorized by the copyright holders of that material supplement the terms of this license with terms a disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this license or b requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal notices displayed by works containing it or c prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version or d limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material or e declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names trademarks or service marks or f requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material or modified versions of it with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors all other non permissive additional terms are considered “ further restrictions ” within the meaning of section 10 if the program as you received it or any part of it contains a notice stating that it is governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction you may remove that term if a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section you must place in the relevant source files a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms additional terms permissive or non permissive may be stated in the form of a separately written license or stated as exceptions the above requirements apply either way 8 termination you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11 however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license for any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10 9 acceptance not required for having copies you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a copy of the program ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer to peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance however nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or propagating a covered work you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so 10 automatic licensing of downstream recipients each time you convey a covered work the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run modify and propagate that work subject to this license you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license an “ entity transaction ” is a transaction transferring control of an organization or substantially all assets of one or subdividing an organization or merging organizations if propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license for example you may not impose a license fee royalty or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this license and you may not initiate litigation including a cross claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making using selling offering for sale or importing the program or any portion of it 11 patents a “ contributor ” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or a work on which the program is based the work thus licensed is called the contributor s “ contributor version ” a contributor s “ essential patent claims ” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor whether already acquired or hereafter acquired that would be infringed by some manner permitted by this license of making using or selling its contributor version but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version for purposes of this definition “ control ” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license each contributor grants you a non exclusive worldwide royalty free patent license under the contributor s essential patent claims to make use sell offer for sale import and otherwise run modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version in the following three paragraphs a “ patent license ” is any express agreement or commitment however denominated not to enforce a patent such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement to “ grant ” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party if you convey a covered work knowingly relying on a patent license and the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy free of charge and under the terms of this license through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means then you must either 1 cause the corresponding source to be so available or 2 arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work or 3 arrange in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license to extend the patent license to downstream recipients “ knowingly relying ” means you have actual knowledge that but for the patent license your conveying the covered work in a country or your recipient s use of the covered work in a country would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid if pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of a covered work and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use propagate modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it a patent license is “ discriminatory ” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage prohibits the exercise of or is conditioned on the non exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license you may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work and under which the third party grants to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you a discriminatory patent license a in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you or copies made from those copies or b primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work unless you entered into that arrangement or that patent license was granted prior to 28 march 2007 nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law 12 no surrender of others freedom if conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not convey it at all for example if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the program the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program 13 use with the gnu affero general public license notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the gnu affero general public license into a single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the special requirements of the gnu affero general public license section 13 concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such 14 revised versions of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the gnu general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies that a certain numbered version of the gnu general public license “ or any later version ” applies to it you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of the gnu general public license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu general public license can be used that proxy s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the program later license versions may give you additional or different permissions however no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version 15 disclaimer of warranty there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program “ as is ” without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 16 limitation of liability in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who modifies and or conveys the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages 17 interpretation of sections 15 and 16 if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above can not be given local legal effect according to their terms reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the “ copyright ” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does copyright copyright year name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version 3 of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program if not see http www gnu org licenses also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail if the program does terminal interaction make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode program copyright copyright year name of author this program comes with absolutely no warranty for details type show w this is free software and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions type show c for details the hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the general public license of course your program s commands might be different for a gui interface you would use an “ about box ” you should also get your employer if you work as a programmer or school if any to sign a “ copyright disclaimer ” for the program if necessary for more information on this and how to apply and follow the gnu gpl see http www gnu org licenses the gnu general public license does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs if your program is a subroutine library you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library if this is what you want to do use the gnu lesser general public license instead of this license but first please read http www gnu org philosophy why not

"LGPL-2.1+","gnu lesser general public license version 2 1 february 1999 copyright copyright 1991 1999 free software foundation inc 51 franklin street fifth floor boston ma 02110 1301 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed this is the first released version of the lesser gpl it also counts as the successor of the gnu library public license version 2 hence the version number 2 1 preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this license the lesser general public license applies to some specially designated software packages typically libraries of the free software foundation and other authors who decide to use it you can use it too but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary general public license is the better strategy to use in any particular case based on the explanations below when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom of use not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs and that you are informed that you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of the library whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code if you link other code with the library you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with a two step method 1 we copyright the library and 2 we offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the library to protect each distributor we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library also if the library is modified by someone else and passed on the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version so that the original author s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others finally software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program we wish to make sure that a company can not effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder therefore we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license most gnu software including some libraries is covered by the ordinary gnu general public license this license the gnu lesser general public license applies to certain designated libraries and is quite different from the ordinary general public license we use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non free programs when a program is linked with a library whether statically or using a shared library the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work a derivative of the original library the ordinary general public license therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom the lesser general public license permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library we call this license the lesser general public license because it does less to protect the user s freedom than the ordinary general public license it also provides other free software developers less of an advantage over competing non free programs these disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary general public license for many libraries however the lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances for example on rare occasions there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library so that it becomes a de facto standard to achieve this non free programs must be allowed to use the library a more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non free libraries in this case there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only so we use the lesser general public license in other cases permission to use a particular library in non free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software for example permission to use the gnu c library in non free programs enables many more people to use the whole gnu operating system as well as its variant the gnu linux operating system although the lesser general public license is less protective of the users freedom it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the library the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow pay close attention to the difference between a work based on the library and a work that uses the library the former contains code derived from the library whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0 this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions and or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does 1 you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library s complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee 2 you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the modified work must itself be a software library b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well defined independent of the application therefore subsection 2d requires that any application supplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license 3 you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version 2 instead of to this license if a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library 4 you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code 5 a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section 6 otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section 6 any executables containing that work also fall under section 6 whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself 6 as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine readable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections 1 and 2 above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machine readable work that uses the library as object code and or source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library a suitable mechanism is one that 1 uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user s computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and 2 will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interface compatible with the version that the work was made with c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection 6a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you can not use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute 7 you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work 8 you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance 9 you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it 10 each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license 11 if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license 12 if the distribution and or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license 13 the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation 14 if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty 15 because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 16 in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the library as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new libraries if you develop a new library and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change you can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms or alternatively under the terms of the ordinary general public license to apply these terms attach the following notices to the library it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the library s name and an idea of what it does copyright copyright year name of author this library is free software you

and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies by contrast our general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users the general public license applies to the free software foundation s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it you can use it for your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price specifically the general public license is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of a such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that you have you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must tell them their rights we protect your rights with two steps 1 copyright the software and 2 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software also for each author s protection and ours we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software if the software is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow gnu general public license terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0 this license agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this general public license the program below refers to any such program or work and a work based on the program means either the program or any work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications each licensee is addressed as you 1 you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this general public license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this general public license along with the program you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy 2 you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of paragraph 1 above provided that you also do the following a cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change and b cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains the program or any part thereof either with or without modifications to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this general public license except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties at your option c if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this general public license d you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee mere aggregation of another independent work with the program or its derivative on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms 3 you may copy and distribute the program or a portion or derivative of it under paragraph 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following a accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 above or b accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party free except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 above or c accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for an executable file complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains but as a special exception it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system 4 you may not copy modify sublicense distribute or transfer the program except as expressly provided under this general public license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense distribute or transfer the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights to use the program under this license however parties who have received copies or rights to use copies from you under this general public license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance 5 by copying distributing or modifying the program or any work based on the program you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions 6 each time you redistribute the program or any work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein 7 the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of the license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation 8 if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty 9 because the program is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 10 in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages end of terms and conditions appendix how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does copyright copyright 19yy name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version 1 or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program if not write to the free software foundation inc

"GPL-3.0","gnu general public license version 3 29 june 2007 copyright copyright 2007 free software foundation inc http fsf org everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the gnu general public license is a free copyleft license for software and other kinds of works the licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free software for all its users we the free software foundation use the gnu general public license for most of our software it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for them if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights therefore you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it responsibilities to respect the freedom of others for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights developers that use the gnu gpl protect your rights with two steps 1 assert copyright on the software and 2 offer you this license giving you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify it for the developers and authors protection the gpl clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software for both users and authors sake the gpl requires that modified versions be marked as changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them although the manufacturer can do so this is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users freedom to change the software the systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use which is precisely where it is most unacceptable therefore we have designed this version of the gpl to prohibit the practice for those products if such problems arise substantially in other domains we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the gpl as needed to protect the freedom of users finally every program is threatened constantly by software patents states should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general purpose computers but in those that do we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary to prevent this the gpl assures that patents can not be used to render the program non free the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions 0 definitions this license refers to version 3 of the gnu general public license copyright also means copyright like laws that apply to other kinds of works such as semiconductor masks the program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this license each licensee is addressed as you licensees and recipients may be individuals or organizations to modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission other than the making of an exact copy the resulting work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work based on the earlier work a covered work means either the unmodified program or a work based on the program to propagate a work means to do anything with it that without permission would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy propagation includes copying distribution with or without modification making available to the public and in some countries other activities as well to convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies mere interaction with a user through a computer network with no transfer of a copy is not conveying an interactive user interface displays appropriate legal notices to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that 1 displays an appropriate copyright notice and 2 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work except to the extent that warranties are provided that licensees may convey the work under this license and how to view a copy of this license if the interface presents a list of user commands or options such as a menu a prominent item in the list meets this criterion 1 source code the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it object code means any non source form of a work a standard interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body or in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language one that is widely used among developers working in that language the system libraries of an executable work include anything other than the work as a whole that a is included in the normal form of packaging a major component but which is not part of that major component and b serves only to enable use of the work with that major component or to implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form a major component in this context means a major essential component kernel window system and so on of the specific operating system if any on which the executable work runs or a compiler used to produce the work or an object code interpreter used to run it the corresponding source for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate install and for an executable work run the object code and to modify the work including scripts to control those activities however it does not include the work s system libraries or general purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work for example corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work 2 basic permissions all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of copyright on the program and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program the output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the output given its content constitutes a covered work this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent as provided by copyright law you may make run and propagate covered works that you do not convey without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force you may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you or provide you with facilities for running those works provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf under your direction and control on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below sublicensing is not allowed section 10 makes it unnecessary 3 protecting users legal rights from anti circumvention law no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on 20 december 1996 or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures when you convey a covered work you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing against the work s users your or third parties legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures 4 conveying verbatim copies you may convey verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice keep intact all notices stating that this license and any non permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the program you may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee 5 conveying modified source versions you may convey a work based on the program or the modifications to produce it from the program in the form of source code under the terms of section 4 provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it and giving a relevant date b the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section 7 this requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to keep intact all notices c you must license the entire work as a whole under this license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy this license will therefore apply along with any applicable section 7 additional terms to the whole of the work and all its parts regardless of how they are packaged this license gives no permission to license the work in any other way but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it d if the work has interactive user interfaces each must display appropriate legal notices however if the program has interactive interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices your work need not make them do so a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation s users beyond what the individual works permit inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate 6 conveying non source forms you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5 provided that you also convey the machine readable corresponding source under the terms of this license in one of these ways a convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange b convey the object code in or embodied in a physical product including a physical distribution medium accompanied by a written offer valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model to give anyone who possesses the object code either 1 a copy of the corresponding source for all the software in the product that is covered by this license on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source or 2 access to copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge c convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially and only if you received the object code with such an offer in accord with subsection 6b d convey the object code by offering access from a designated place gratis or for a charge and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no further charge you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code if the place to copy the object code is a network server the corresponding source may be on a different server operated by you or a third party that supports equivalent copying facilities provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements e convey the object code using peer to peer transmission provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d a separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source as a system library need not be included in conveying the object code work a user product is either 1 a consumer product which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal family or household purposes or 2 anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling in determining whether a product is a consumer product doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage for a particular product received by a particular user normally used refers to a typical or common use of that class of product regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses or expects or is expected to use the product a product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial industrial or non consumer uses unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product installation information for a user product means any methods procedures authorization keys or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from a modified version of its corresponding source the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made if you convey an object code work under this section in or with or specifically for use in a user product and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term regardless of how the transaction is characterized the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product for example the work has been installed in rom the requirement to provide installation information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service warranty or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient or for the user product in which it has been modified or installed access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network corresponding source conveyed and installation information provided in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented and with an implementation available to the public in source code form and must require no special password or key for unpacking reading or copying 7 additional terms additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated as though they were included in this license to the extent that they are valid under applicable law if additional permissions apply only to part of the program that part may be used separately under those permissions but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions when you convey a copy of a covered work you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy or from any part of it additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work you may place additional permissions on material added by you to a covered work for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission notwithstanding any other provision of this license for material you add to a covered work you may if authorized by the copyright holders of that material supplement the terms of this license with terms a disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this license or b requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal notices displayed by works containing it or c prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version or d limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material or e declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names trademarks or service marks or f requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material or modified versions of it with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors all other non permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within the meaning of section 10 if the program as you received it or any part of it contains a notice stating that it is governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction you may remove that term if a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section you must place in the relevant source files a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms additional terms permissive or non permissive may be stated in the form of a separately written license or stated as exceptions the above requirements apply either way 8 termination you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11 however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license for any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10 9 acceptance not required for having copies you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a copy of the program ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer to peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance however nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or propagating a covered work you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so 10 automatic licensing of downstream recipients each time you convey a covered work the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to run modify and propagate that work subject to this license you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license an entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an organization or substantially all assets of one or subdividing an organization or merging organizations if propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license for example you may not impose a license fee royalty or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this license and you may not initiate litigation including a cross claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making using selling offering for sale or importing the program or any portion of it 11 patents a contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or a work on which the program is based the work thus licensed is called the contributor s contributor version a contributor s essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor whether already acquired or hereafter acquired that would be infringed by some manner permitted by this license of making using or selling its contributor version but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version for purposes of this definition control includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license each contributor grants you a non exclusive worldwide royalty free patent license under the contributor s essential patent claims to make use sell offer for sale import and otherwise run modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version in the following three paragraphs a patent license is any express agreement or commitment however denominated not to enforce a patent such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement to grant such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party if you convey a covered work knowingly relying on a patent license and the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy free of charge and under the terms of this license through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means then you must either 1 cause the corresponding source to be so available or 2 arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work or 3 arrange in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license to extend the patent license to downstream recipients knowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that but for the patent license your conveying the covered work in a country or your recipient s use of the covered work in a country would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid if pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring conveyance of a covered work and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use propagate modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it a patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of its coverage prohibits the exercise of or is conditioned on the non exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license you may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work and under which the third party grants to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you a discriminatory patent license a in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you or copies made from those copies or b primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work unless you entered into that arrangement or that patent license was granted prior to 28 march 2007 nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law 12 no surrender of others freedom if conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not convey it at all for example if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the program the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program 13 use with the gnu affero general public license notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the gnu affero general public license into a single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the special requirements of the gnu affero general public license section 13 concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such 14 revised versions of this license the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the gnu general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies that a certain numbered version of the gnu general public license or any later version applies to it you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of the gnu general public license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu general public license can be used that proxy s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the program later license versions may give you additional or different permissions however no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version 15 disclaimer of warranty there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 16 limitation of liability in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who modifies and or conveys the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages 17 interpretation of sections 15 and 16 if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above can not be given local legal effect according to their terms reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does copyright copyright year name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version 3 of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program if not see http www gnu org licenses also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail if the program does terminal interaction make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode program copyright copyright year name of author this program comes with absolutely no warranty for details type show w this is free software and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions type show c for details the hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the general public license of course your program s commands might be different for a gui interface you would use an about box you should also get your employer if you work as a programmer or school if any to sign a copyright disclaimer for the program if necessary for more information on this and how to apply and follow the gnu gpl see http www gnu org licenses the gnu general public license does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs if your program is a subroutine library you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library if this is what you want to do use the gnu lesser general public license instead of this license but first please read http www gnu org philosophy why not lgpl html"

python 1 6 was the last of the versions released by cnri in 2000 guido and the python core development team moved to beopen com to form the beopen pythonlabs team python 2 0 was the first and only release from beopen com following the release of python 1 6 and after guido van rossum left cnri to work with commercial software developers it became clear that the ability to use python with software available under the gnu public license gpl was very desirable cnri and the free software foundation fsf interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the python license python 1 6 1 is essentially the same as python 1 6 with a few minor bug fixes and with a different license that enables later versions to be gpl compatible python 2 1 is a derivative work of python 1 6 1 as well as

"LPPL-1.0","latex project public license lppl version 1 0 1999 03 01 copyright 1999 latex3 project everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but modification is not allowed preamble the latex project public license lppl is the license under which the base latex distribution is distributed as described below you may use this licence for any software that you wish to distribute it may be particularly suitable if your software is tex related such as a latex package file but it may be used for any software even if it is unrelated to tex to use this license the files of your distribution should have an explicit copyright notice giving your name and the year together with a reference to this license a typical example would be pig sty copyright 2001 m y name this program can redistributed and or modified under the terms of the latex project public license distributed from ctan archives in directory macros latex base lppl txt either version 1 of the license or at your option any later version given such a notice in the file the conditions of this document would apply with the program referring to the software pig sty and the copyright holder referring to the person m y name to see a real example see the file legal txt which carries the copyright notice for the base latex distribution this license gives terms under which files of the program may be distributed and modified individual files may have specific further constraints on modification but no file should have restrictions on distribution other than those specified below this is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete unmodified copy of the program need only check the conditions in this file and does not need to check every file in the program for extra restrictions if you do need to modify the distribution terms of some files do not refer to this license instead distribute the program under a different license you may use the parts of the text of lppl as a model for your own license but your license should not directly refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that the program is distributed under the lppl the latex project public license terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification warranty there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holder provides the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will the copyright holder or any of the individual authors named in the source for the program be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the program or out of inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third parties as a result of a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages distribution redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files that make up the distribution of the program are distributed in particular this means that the program has to be distributed including its documentation if documentation was part of the original distribution the distribution of the program will contain a prominent file listing all the files covered by this license if you receive only some of these files from someone complain the distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the the program and the reuse of code from the program are allowed under the following restrictions it is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not expressly forbid it see note below under conditions on individual files you rename the file before you make any changes to it unless the file explicitly says that renaming is not required any such changed files must be distributed under a license that forbids distribution of those files and any files derived from them under the names used by the original files in the distribution of the program you change any identification string in the program to clearly indicate that the file is not part of the standard system if the program includes an error report address so that errors may be reported to the copyright holder or other specified addresses this address must be changed in any modified versions of the program so that reports for files not maintained by the original program maintainers are directed to the maintainers of the changed files you acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version in the modified file you also distribute the unmodified version of the file or alternatively provide sufficient information so that the user of your modified file can be reasonably expected to be able to obtain an original unmodified copy of the program for example you may specify a url to a site that you expect will freely provide the user with a copy of the program either the version on which your modification is based or perhaps a later version if the program is intended to be used with or is based on latex then files with the following file extensions which have special meaning in latex software have special modification rules under the license files with extension ins installation files these files may not be modified at all because they contain the legal notices that are placed in the generated files files with extension fd latex font definitions files these files are allowed to be modified without changing the name but only to enable use of all available fonts and to prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts however modified files are not allowed to be distributed in place of original files files with extension cfg configuration files these files can be created or modified to enable easy configuration of the system the documentation in cfgguide tex in the base latex distribution describes when it makes sense to modify or generate such files the above restrictions are not intended to prohibit and hence do not apply to the updating by any method of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file in the program notes we believe that these requirements give you the freedom you to make modifications that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish whilst maintaining the availability integrity and reliability of the program if you do not see how to achieve your goal whilst adhering to these requirements then read the document cfgguide tex in the base latex distribution for suggestions because of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems like latex the latex3 project deprecates the distribution of non standard versions of components of latex or of generally available contributed code for them but such distributions are permitted under the above restrictions the document modguide tex in the base latex distribution details the reasons for the legal requirements detailed above even if the program is unrelated to latex the argument in modguide tex may still apply and should be read before a modified version of the program is distributed conditions on individual files the individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede the general conditions on distribution and modification contained in this file if there are any such files the distribution of the program will contain a prominent file that lists all the exceptional files typical examples of files with more restrictive modification conditions would be files that contain the text of copyright notices the conditions on individual files differ only in the extent of modification that is allowed the conditions on distribution are the same for all the files thus a re distributor of a complete unchanged copy of the program need meet only the conditions in this file it is not necessary to check the header of every file in the distribution to check that a distribution meets these requirements"

"LGPL-2.0","gnu library general public license version 2 june 1991 copyright copyright 1991 free software foundation inc 51 franklin st fifth floor boston ma 02110 1301 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed this is the first released version of the library gpl it is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary gpl preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this license the library general public license applies to some specially designated free software foundation software and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it you can use it for your libraries too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of the library whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code if you link a program with the library you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it and you must show them these terms so they know their rights our method of protecting your rights has two steps 1 copyright the library and 2 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the library also for each distributor s protection we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library if the library is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations finally any free program is threatened constantly by software patents we wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software to prevent this we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone s free use or not licensed at all most gnu software including some libraries is covered by the ordinary gnu general public license which was designed for utility programs this license the gnu library general public license applies to certain designated libraries this license is quite different from the ordinary one be sure to read it in full and don t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license the reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it linking a program with a library without changing the library is in some sense simply using the library and is analogous to running a utility program or application program however in a textual and legal sense the linked executable is a combined work a derivative of the original library and the ordinary general public license treats it as such because of this blurred distinction using the ordinary general public license for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing because most developers did not use the libraries we concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better however unrestricted linking of non free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves this library general public license is intended to permit developers of non free programs to use free libraries while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them we have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the library the hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow pay close attention to the difference between a work based on the library and a work that uses the library the former contains code derived from the library while the latter only works together with the library note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary general public license rather than by this special one terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0 this license agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this library general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions and or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does 1 you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library s complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee 2 you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the modified work must itself be a software library b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well defined independent of the application therefore subsection 2d requires that any application supplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license 3 you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version 2 instead of to this license if a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library 4 you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code 5 a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section 6 otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section 6 any executables containing that work also fall under section 6 whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself 6 as an exception to the sections above you may also compile or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine readable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections 1 and 2 above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machine readable work that uses the library as object code and or source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions b accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection 6a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution c if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place d verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you can not use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute 7 you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work 8 you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance 9 you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it 10 each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license 11 if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license 12 if the distribution and or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license 13 the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the library general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the library does not specify a license version number you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation 14 if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty 15 because the library is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the library to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the library as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you should the library prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 16 in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the library as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new libraries if you develop a new library and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change you can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms or alternatively under the terms of the ordinary general public license to apply these terms attach the following notices to the library it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the library s name and an idea of what it does copyright copyright year name of author this library is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu library general public license as published by the free software foundation either version 2 of the license or at your option any later version this library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu library general public license for more details you should have

copyright holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the work that the work can only be maintained by the copyright holder or simply that is author maintained the work has the status maintained if there is a current maintainer who has indicated in the work that they are willing to receive error reports for the work for example by supplying a valid e mail address it is not required for the current maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports the work changes from status maintained to unmaintained if there is no current maintainer or the person stated to be current maintainer of the work can not be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance you can become the current maintainer of the work by agreement with any existing current maintainer to take over this role if the work is unmaintained you can become the current maintainer of the work through the following steps 1 make a reasonable attempt to trace the current maintainer and the copyright holder if the two differ through the means of an internet or similar search 2 if this search is successful then enquire whether the work is still maintained a if it is being maintained then ask the current maintainer to update their communication data within one month b if the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the current maintainer then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance if the work is a latex work this could be done for example by posting to comp text tex 3a if the current maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the work to you then this takes effect immediately upon announcement b if the current maintainer is not reachable and the copyright holder agrees that maintenance of the work be passed to you then this takes effect immediately upon announcement 4 if you make an intention announcement as described in 2b above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the current maintainer nor by the copyright holder nor by other people then you may arrange for the work to be changed so as to name you as the new current maintainer 5 if the previously unreachable current maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b or 4 then that current maintainer must become or remain the current maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month a change in the current maintainer does not of itself alter the fact that the work is distributed under the lppl license if you become the current maintainer of the work you should immediately provide within the work a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as current maintainer you should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b above whether and how to distribute works under this license this section contains important instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license these authors are addressed as you in this section choosing this license or another license if for any part of your work you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ significantly from those in this license then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but instead distribute your work under a different license you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the lppl the document modguide tex in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license it explains for example why distributing latex under the gnu general public license gpl was considered inappropriate even if your work is unrelated to latex the discussion in modguide tex may still be relevant and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it a recommendation on modification without distribution it is wise never to modify a component of the work even for your own personal use without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component while you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed often this will happen by accident you may forget that you have modified that component or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and worse cause problems for the community it is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the work identical with the public one many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components how to use this license to use this license place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and or last substantially modified include also a statement that the distribution and or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license here is an example of such a notice and statement pig dtx copyright 2003 m y name this work may be distributed and or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license either version 1 3 of this license or at your option any later version the latest version of this license is in http www latex project org lppl txt and version 1 3 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 2003 12 01 or later this work has the lppl maintenance status maintained this current maintainer of this work is m y name this work consists of the files pig dtx and pig ins and the derived file pig sty given such a notice and statement in a file the conditions given in this license document would apply with the work referring to the three files pig dtx pig ins and pig sty the last being generated from pig dtx using pig ins the base interpreter referring to any latex format and both copyright holder and current maintainer referring to the person m y name to prevent the maintenance section of lppl from allowing someone else to become the current maintainer without your agreement you could change maintained above into author maintained important recommendations defining what constitutes the work the lppl requires that distributions of the work contain all the files of the work it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the work this could for example be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as this work consists of all files listed in manifest txt in that place in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the work and in such a case the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the work"

prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws no warranty there is no warranty for the work except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holder provides the work as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the work is with you should the work prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will the copyright holder or any author named in the components of the work or any other party who may distribute and or modify the work as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the work or out of inability to use the work including but not limited to loss of data data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the work to operate with any other programs even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages maintenance of the work the work has the status author maintained if the copyright holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the work that the work can only be maintained by the copyright holder or simply that it is author maintained the work has the status maintained if there is a current maintainer who has indicated in the work that they are willing to receive error reports for the work for example by supplying a valid e mail address it is not required for the current maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports the work changes from status maintained to unmaintained if there is no current maintainer or the person stated to be current maintainer of the work can not be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance you can become the current maintainer of the work by agreement with any existing current maintainer to take over this role if the work is unmaintained you can become the current maintainer of the work through the following steps 1 make a reasonable attempt to trace the current maintainer and the copyright holder if the two differ through the means of an internet or similar search 2 if this search is successful then enquire whether the work is still maintained a if it is being maintained then ask the current maintainer to update their communication data within one month b if the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the current maintainer then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance if the work is a latex work this could be done for example by posting to comp text tex 3a if the current maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the work to you then this takes effect immediately upon announcement b if the current maintainer is not reachable and the copyright holder agrees that maintenance of the work be passed to you then this takes effect immediately upon announcement 4 if you make an intention announcement as described in 2b above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the current maintainer nor by the copyright holder nor by other people then you may arrange for the work to be changed so as to name you as the new current maintainer 5 if the previously unreachable current maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b or 4 then that current maintainer must become or remain the current maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month a change in the current maintainer does not of itself alter the fact that the work is distributed under the lppl license if you become the current maintainer of the work you should immediately provide within the work a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as current maintainer you should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b above whether and how to distribute works under this license this section contains important instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license these authors are addressed as you in this section choosing this license or another license if for any part of your work you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ significantly from those in this license then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but instead distribute your work under a different license you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the lppl the document modguide tex in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license it explains for example why distributing latex under the gnu general public license gpl was considered inappropriate even if your work is unrelated to latex the discussion in modguide tex may still be relevant and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it a recommendation on modification without distribution it is wise never to modify a component of the work even for your own personal use without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component while you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed often this will happen by accident you may forget that you have modified that component or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and worse cause problems for the community it is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the work identical with the public one many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components how to use this license to use this license place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and or last substantially modified include also a statement that the distribution and or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license here is an example of such a notice and statement pig dtx copyright 2005 m y name this work may be distributed and or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license either version 1 3 of this license or at your option any later version the latest version of this license is in http www latex project org lppl txt and version 1 3 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 2005 12 01 or later this work has the lppl maintenance status maintained the current maintainer of this work is m y name this work consists of the files pig dtx and pig ins and the derived file pig sty given such a notice and statement in a file the conditions given in this license document would apply with the work referring to the three files pig dtx pig ins and pig sty the last being generated from pig dtx using pig ins the base interpreter referring to any latex format and both copyright holder and current maintainer referring to the person m y name if you do not want the maintenance section of lppl to apply to your work change maintained above into author maintained however we recommend that you use maintained as the maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself derived works that are not replacements several clauses of the lppl specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community they therefore concern themselves with the case that a derived work is intended to be used as a compatible or incompatible replacement of the original work if this is not the case e g if a few lines of code are reused for a completely different task then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply important recommendations defining what constitutes the work the lppl requires that distributions of the work contain all the files of the work it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the work this could for example be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as this work consists of all files listed in manifest txt in that place in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the work and in such a case the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the work"

use a work and acknowledges the right holder ’ s and the user ’ s rights and responsibility the invention and development of digital technologies internet and free software have changed creation methods creations of the human mind can obviously be distributed exchanged and transformed they allow to produce common works to which everyone can contribute to the benefit of all the main rationale

created by the initiator of the common work as defined above the copies of which can be modified by whoever wants to “ subsequent works ” means the contributions made by authors who participate in the evolution of the common work by exercising the rights to reproduce distribute and modify that are granted by the license “ originals ” sources or resources of the work means all copies of either the

modify copies of the work including for commercial purposes and without any other restrictions than those required by the respect of the other compatibility criteria it ensures proper attribution of

"OpenDefinition","the open source definition annotated version 1 9 the indented italicized sections below appear as annotations to the open source definition osd and are not a part of the osd a plain version of the osd without annotations can be found here introduction open source doesn t just mean access to the source code the distribution terms of open source software must comply with the following criteria 1 free redistribution the license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources the license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale rationale by constraining the license to require free redistribution we eliminate the temptation to throw away many long term gains in order to make a few short term sales dollars if we didn t do this there would be lots of pressure for cooperators to defect 2 source code the program must include source code and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form where some form of a product is not distributed with source code there must be a well publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably downloading via the internet without charge the source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed rationale we require access to un obfuscated source code because you can t evolve programs without modifying them since our purpose is to make evolution easy we require that modification be made easy 3 derived works the license must allow modifications and derived works and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software rationale the mere ability to read source isn t enough to support independent peer review and rapid evolutionary selection for rapid evolution to happen people need to be able to experiment with and redistribute modifications 4 integrity of the author s source code the license may restrict source code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of patch files with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time the license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code the license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software rationale encouraging lots of improvement is a good thing but users have a right to know who is responsible for the software they are using authors and maintainers have reciprocal right to know what they re being asked to support and protect their reputations accordingly an open source license must guarantee that source be readily available but may require that it be distributed as pristine base sources plus patches in this way unofficial changes can be made available but readily distinguished from the base source 5 no discrimination against persons or groups the license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons rationale in order to get the maximum benefit from the process the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open sources therefore we forbid any open source license from locking anybody out of the process some countries including the united states have export restrictions for certain types of software an osd conformant license may warn licensees of applicable restrictions and remind them that they are obliged to obey the law however it may not incorporate such restrictions itself 6 no discrimination against fields of endeavor the license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor for example it may not restrict the program from being used in a business or from being used for genetic research rationale the major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open source from being used commercially we want commercial users to join our community not feel excluded from it 7 distribution of license the rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties rationale this clause is intended to forbid closing up software by indirect means such as requiring a non disclosure agreement 8 license must not be specific to a product the rights attached to the program must not depend on the program s being part of a particular software distribution if the program is extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the terms of the program s license all parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution rationale this clause forecloses yet another class of license traps 9 license must not restrict other software the license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software for example the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open source software rationale distributors of open source software have the right to make their own choices about their own software yes the gpl is conformant with this requirement software linked with gpled libraries only inherits the gpl if it forms a single work not any software with which they are merely distributed 10 license must be technology neutral no provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface rationale this provision is aimed specifically at licenses which require an explicit gesture of assent in order to establish a contract between licensor and licensee provisions mandating so called click wrap may conflict with important methods of software distribution such as ftp download cd rom anthologies and web mirroring such provisions may also hinder code re use conformant licenses must allow for the possibility that a redistribution of the software will take place over non web channels that do not support click wrapping of the download and that b the covered code or re used portions of covered code may run in a non gui environment that can not support popup dialogues"

regarding them the invariant sections are certain secondary sections whose titles are designated as being those of invariant sections in the notice that says that the document is released under this license if a section does not fit the above definition of secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as invariant the document may contain zero invariant sections if the document does not identify any invariant sections then there are none the cover texts are certain short passages of text that are listed as front cover texts or back cover texts in the notice that says that the document is released under this license a front cover text may be at most 5 words and a back cover text may be at most 25 words a transparent copy of the document means a machine readable copy represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or for images composed of pixels generic paint programs or for drawings some widely available drawing editor and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters a copy made in an otherwise transparent file format whose markup or absence of markup has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not transparent an image format is not transparent if used for any substantial amount of text a copy that is not transparent is called opaque examples of suitable formats for transparent copies include plain ascii without markup texinfo input format latex input format sgml or xml using a publicly available dtd and standard conforming simple html postscript or pdf designed for human modification examples of transparent image formats include png xcf and jpg opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors sgml or xml for which the dtd and or processing tools are not generally available and the machine generated html postscript or pdf produced by some word processors for output purposes only the title page means for a printed book the title page itself plus such following pages as are needed to hold legibly the material this license requires to appear in the title page for works in formats which do not have any title page as such title page means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work s title preceding the beginning of the body of the text a section entitled xyz means a named subunit of the document whose title either is precisely xyz or contains xyz in parentheses following text that translates xyz in another language here xyz stands for a specific section name mentioned below such as acknowledgements dedications endorsements or history to preserve the title of such a section when you modify the document means that it remains a section entitled xyz according to this definition the document may

conditions can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects if the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly you should put the first ones listed as many as fit reasonably on the actual cover and continue the rest onto adjacent pages if you publish or distribute opaque copies of the document numbering more than 100 you must either include a machine readable transparent copy along with each opaque copy or state in or with each opaque copy a computer network location from which the general network using public has access to download using public standard network protocols a complete transparent copy of the document free of added material if you use the latter option you must take reasonably prudent steps when you begin distribution of opaque copies in

modification of it is not allowed preamble the latex project public license lppl is the primary license under which the latex kernel and the base latex packages are distributed you may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute this license may be particularly suitable if your work is tex related such as a latex package but it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to tex the section whether and how to distribute works under this license below gives instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license this license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed we the latex3 project believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability integrity and reliability of that work if you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions then read the document cfgguide tex and modguide tex in the base latex distribution for suggestions definitions in this license document the following terms are used work any work being distributed under this license derived work any work that under any applicable law is derived from the work modification any procedure that produces a derived work under any applicable law for example the production of a file containing an original file associated with the work or a significant portion of such a file either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language modify to apply any procedure that produces a derived work under any applicable law distribution making copies of the work available from one person to another in whole or in part distribution includes but is not limited to making any electronic components of the work accessible by file transfer protocols such as ftp or http or by shared file systems such as sun s network file system nfs compiled work a version of the work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system this processing may include using installation facilities provided by the work transformations of the work copying of components of the work or other activities note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the work constitutes modification of the work current maintainer a person or persons nominated as such within the work if there is no such explicit nomination then it is the copyright holder under any applicable law base interpreter a program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the work a base interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the base interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the work the only applicable base interpreter is a latex format or in the case of files belonging to the latex format a program implementing the tex language conditions on distribution and modification 1 activities other than distribution and or modification of the work are not covered by this license they are outside its scope in particular the act of running the work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the work 2 you may distribute a complete unmodified copy of the work as you received it distribution of only part of the work is considered modification of the work and no right to distribute such a derived work may be assumed under the terms of this clause 3 you may distribute a compiled work that has been generated from a complete unmodified copy of the work as distributed under clause 2 above as long as that compiled work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the compiled work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a compiled work directly from the work 4 if you are the current maintainer of the work you may without restriction modify the work thus creating a derived work you may also distribute the derived work without restriction including compiled works generated from the derived work derived works distributed in this manner by the current maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the work 5 if you are not the current maintainer of the work you may modify your copy of the work thus creating a derived work based on the work and compile this derived work thus creating a compiled work based on the derived work 6 if you are not the current maintainer of the work you may distribute a derived work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition only the current maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the work a if a component of this derived work can be a direct replacement for a component of the work when that component is used with the base interpreter then wherever this component of the work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that base interpreter the replacement component of this derived work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that base interpreter b every component of the derived work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the derived work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes c no information in the derived work implies that any persons including but not limited to the authors of the original version of the work provide any support including but not limited to the reporting and handling of errors to recipients of the derived work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the derived work d you distribute at least one of the following with the derived work 1 a complete unmodified copy of the work if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the work from the same or some similar place meets this condition even though third parties are not compelled to copy the work along with the modified component 2 information that is sufficient to obtain a complete unmodified copy of the work 7 if you are not the current maintainer of the work you may distribute a compiled work generated from a derived work as long as the derived work is distributed to all recipients of the compiled work and as long as the conditions of clause 6 above are met with regard to the derived work 8 the conditions above are not intended to prohibit and hence do not apply to the modification by any method of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the work as it is distributed by the current maintainer under clause 4 above 9 distribution of the work or any derived work in an alternative format where the work or that derived work in whole or in part is then produced by applying some process to that format does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process 10 a a derived work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in clause 6 above in regard to the work though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license b if a derived work is distributed under a different license that derived work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that derived work to honor the restrictions in clause 6 above concerning changes from the work 11 this license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the work nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the work by any means 12 nothing in this license is intended to or may be used to prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws no warranty there is no warranty for the work except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holder provides the work as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the work is with you should the work prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will the copyright holder or any author named in the components of the work or any other party who may distribute and or modify the work as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the work or out of inability to use the work including but not limited to loss of data data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the work to operate with any other programs even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages maintenance of the work the work has the status author maintained if the copyright holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the work that the work can only be maintained by the copyright holder or simply that it is author maintained the work has the status maintained if there is a current maintainer who has indicated in the work that they are willing to receive error reports for the work for example by supplying a valid e mail address it is not required for the current maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports the work changes from status maintained to unmaintained if there is no current maintainer or the person stated to be current maintainer of the work can not be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance you can become the current maintainer of the work by agreement with any existing current maintainer to take over this role if the work is unmaintained you can become the current maintainer of the work through the following steps 1 make a reasonable attempt to trace the current maintainer and the copyright holder if the two differ through the means of an internet or similar search 2 if this search is successful then enquire whether the work is still maintained a if it is being maintained then ask the current maintainer to update their communication data within one month b if the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the current maintainer then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance if the work is a latex work this could be done for example by posting to comp text tex 3a if the current maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the work to you then this takes effect immediately upon announcement b if the current maintainer is not reachable and the copyright holder agrees that maintenance of the work be passed to you then this takes effect immediately upon announcement 4 if you make an intention announcement as described in 2b above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the current maintainer nor by the copyright holder nor by other people then you may arrange for the work to be changed so as to name you as the new current maintainer 5 if the previously unreachable current maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b or 4 then that current maintainer must become or remain the current maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month a change in the current maintainer does not of itself alter the fact that the work is distributed under the lppl license if you become the current maintainer of the work you should immediately provide within the work a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as current maintainer you should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b above whether and how to distribute works under this license this section contains important instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license these authors are addressed as you in this section choosing this license or another license if for any part of your work you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ significantly from those in this license then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but instead distribute your work under a different license you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the lppl the document modguide tex in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license it explains for example why distributing latex under the gnu general public license gpl was considered inappropriate even if your work is unrelated to latex the discussion in modguide tex may still be relevant and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it a recommendation on modification without distribution it is wise never to modify a component of the work even for your own personal use without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component while you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed often this will happen by accident you may forget that you have modified that component or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and worse cause problems for the community it is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the work identical with the public one many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components how to use this license to use this license place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and or last substantially modified include also a statement that the distribution and or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license here is an example of such a notice and statement pig dtx copyright 2005 m y name this work may be distributed and or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license either version 1 3 of this license or at your option any later version the latest version of this license is in http www latex project org lppl txt and version 1 3 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 2005 12 01 or later this work has the lppl maintenance status maintained the current maintainer of this work is m y name this work consists of the files pig dtx and pig ins and the derived file pig sty given such a notice and statement in a file the conditions given in this license document would apply with the work referring to the three files pig dtx pig ins and pig sty the last being generated from pig dtx using pig ins the base interpreter referring to any latex format and both copyright holder and current maintainer referring to the person m y name if you do not want the maintenance section of lppl to apply to your work change maintained above into author maintained however we recommend that you use maintained as the maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself derived works that are not replacements several clauses of the lppl specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community they therefore concern themselves with the case that a derived work is intended to be used as a compatible or incompatible replacement of the original work if this is not the case e g if a few lines of code are reused for a completely different task then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply important recommendations defining what constitutes the work the lppl requires that distributions of the work contain all the files of the work it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the work this could for example be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as this work consists of all files listed in manifest txt in that place in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the work and in such a case the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the work"

any method must be wholly subject to one of the compatible source licenses notwithstanding the foregoing all covered code must be subject to the terms of this license thus the entire derivative work must be licensed under a combination of the rpsl for covered code and a compatible source license for any independently developed software modules within the derivative work the foregoing requirement

instruction or reference 1 applicability and definitions this license applies to any manual or other work in any medium that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this license such a notice grants a world wide royalty free license unlimited in duration to use that work under the conditions stated herein the document below refers to any such manual or work any member of the public is a licensee and is addressed as you you accept the license if you copy modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law a modified version of the document means any work containing the document or a portion of it either copied verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language a secondary section is a named appendix or a front matter section of the document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the document to the document s overall subject or to related matters and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject thus if the document is in part a textbook of mathematics a secondary section may not explain any mathematics the relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters or of legal commercial philosophical ethical or political position regarding them the invariant sections are certain secondary sections whose titles are designated as being those of invariant sections in the notice that says that the document is released under this license if a section does not fit the above definition of secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as invariant the document may contain zero invariant sections if the document does not identify any invariant sections then there are none the cover texts are certain short passages of text that are listed as front cover texts or back cover texts in the notice that says that the document is released under this license a front cover text may be at most 5 words and a back cover text may be at most 25 words a transparent copy of the document means a machine readable copy represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or for images composed of pixels generic paint programs or for drawings some widely available drawing editor and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters a copy made in an otherwise transparent file format whose markup or absence of markup has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not transparent an image format is not transparent if used for any substantial amount of text a copy that is not transparent is called opaque examples of suitable formats for transparent copies include plain ascii without markup texinfo input format latex input format sgml or xml using a publicly available dtd and standard conforming simple html postscript or pdf designed for human modification examples of transparent image formats include png xcf and jpg opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors sgml or xml for which the dtd and or processing tools are not generally available and the machine generated html postscript or pdf produced by some word processors for output purposes only the title page means for a printed book the title page itself plus such following pages as are needed to hold legibly the material this license requires to appear in the title page for works in formats which do not have any title page as such title page means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work s title preceding the beginning of the body of the text the publisher means any person or entity that distributes copies of the document to the public a section entitled xyz means a named subunit of the document whose title either is precisely xyz or contains xyz in parentheses following text that translates xyz in another language here xyz stands for a specific section name mentioned below such as acknowledgements dedications endorsements or history to preserve the title of such a section when you modify the document means that it remains a section entitled xyz according to this definition the document may include warranty disclaimers next to the notice which states that this license applies to the document these warranty disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this license but only as regards disclaiming warranties any other implication that these warranty disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this license 2 verbatim copying you may copy and distribute the document in any medium either commercially or noncommercially provided that this license the copyright notices and the license notice saying this license applies to the document are reproduced in all copies and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this license you may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute however you may accept compensation in exchange for copies if you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3 you may also lend copies under the same conditions stated above and you may publicly display copies 3 copying in quantity if you publish printed copies or copies in media that commonly have printed covers of the document numbering more than 100 and the document s license notice requires cover texts you must enclose the copies in covers that carry clearly and legibly all these cover texts front cover texts on the front cover and back cover texts on the back cover both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies the front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible you may add other material on the covers in addition copying with changes limited to the covers as long as they preserve the title of the document and satisfy these conditions can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects if the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly you should put the first ones listed as many as fit reasonably on the actual cover and continue the rest onto adjacent pages if you publish or distribute opaque copies of the document numbering more than 100 you must either include a machine readable transparent copy along with each opaque copy or state in or with each opaque copy a computer network location from which the general network using public has access to download using public standard network protocols a complete transparent copy of the document free of added material if you use the latter option you must take reasonably prudent steps when you begin distribution of opaque copies in quantity to ensure that this transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an opaque copy directly or through your agents or retailers of that edition to the public it is requested but not required that you contact the authors of the document well before redistributing any large number of copies to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the document 4 modifications you may copy and distribute a modified version of the document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above provided that you release the modified version under precisely this license with the modified version filling the role of the document thus licensing distribution and modification of the modified version to whoever possesses a copy of it in addition you must do these things in the modified version a use in the title page and on the covers if any a title distinct from that of the document and from those of previous versions which should if there were any be listed in the history section of the document you may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission b list on the title page as authors one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the modified version together with at least five of the principal authors of the document all of its principal authors if it has fewer than five unless they release you from this requirement c state on the title page the name of the publisher of the modified version as the publisher d preserve all the copyright notices of the document e add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices f include immediately after the copyright notices a license notice giving the public permission to use the modified version under the terms of this license in the form shown in the addendum below g preserve in that license notice the full lists of invariant sections and required cover texts given in the document s license notice h include an unaltered copy of this license i preserve the section entitled history preserve its title and add to it an item stating at least the title year new authors and publisher of the modified version as given on the title page if there is no section entitled history in the document create one stating the title year authors and publisher of the document as given on its title page then add an item describing the modified version as stated in the previous sentence j preserve the network location if any given in the document for public access to a transparent copy of the document and likewise the network locations given in the document for previous versions it was based on these may be placed in the history section you may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the document itself or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission k for any section entitled acknowledgements or dedications preserve the title of the section and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and or dedications given therein l preserve all the invariant sections of the document unaltered in their text and in their titles section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles m delete any section entitled endorsements such a section may not be included in the modified version n do not retitle any existing section to be entitled endorsements or to conflict in title with any invariant section o preserve any warranty disclaimers if the modified version includes new front matter sections or appendices that qualify as secondary sections and contain no material copied from the document you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant to do this add their titles to the list of invariant sections in the modified version s license notice these titles must be distinct from any other section titles you may add a section entitled endorsements provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your modified version by various parties—for example statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard you may add a passage of up to five words as a front cover text and a passage of up to 25 words as a back cover text to the end of the list of cover texts in the modified version only one passage of front cover text and one of back cover text may be added by or through arrangements made by any one entity if the document already includes a cover text for the same cover previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of you may not add another but you may replace the old one on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one the author s and publisher s of the document do not by this license give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any modified version 5 combining documents you may combine the document with other documents released under this license under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions provided that you include in the combination all of the invariant sections of all of the original documents unmodified and list them all as invariant sections of your combined work in its license notice and that you preserve all their warranty disclaimers the combined work need only contain one copy of this license and multiple identical invariant sections may be replaced with a single copy if there are multiple invariant sections with the same name but different contents make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it in parentheses the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known or else a unique number make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of invariant sections in the license notice of the combined work in the combination you must combine any sections entitled history in the various original documents forming one section entitled history likewise combine any sections entitled acknowledgements and any sections entitled dedications you must delete all sections entitled endorsements 6 collections of documents you may make a collection consisting of the document and other documents released under this license and replace the individual copies of this license in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection provided that you follow the rules of this license for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects you may extract a single document from such a collection and distribute it individually under this license provided you insert a copy of this license into the extracted document and follow this license in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document 7 aggregation with independent works a compilation of the document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium is called an aggregate if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation s users beyond what the individual works permit when the document is included in an aggregate this license does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the document if the cover text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the document then if the document is less than one half of the entire aggregate the document s cover texts may be placed on covers that bracket the document within the aggregate or the electronic equivalent of covers if the document is in electronic form otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate 8 translation translation is considered a kind of modification so you may distribute translations of the document under the terms of section 4 replacing invariant sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders but you may include translations of some or all invariant sections in addition to the original versions of these invariant sections you may include a translation of this license and all the license notices in the document and any warranty disclaimers provided that you also include the original english version of this license and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers in case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this license or a notice or disclaimer the original version will prevail if a section in the document is entitled acknowledgements dedications or history the requirement section 4 to preserve its title section 1 will typically require changing the actual title 9 termination you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute the document except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense or distribute it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however if you cease all violation of this license then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated a provisionally unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license and b permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation moreover your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license for any work from that copyright holder and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it 10 future revisions of this license the free software foundation may publish new revised versions of the gnu free documentation license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns see http www gnu org copyleft each version of the license is given a distinguishing version number if the document specifies that a particular numbered version of this license or any later version applies to it you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published not as a draft by the free software foundation if the document does not specify a version number of this license you may choose any version ever published not as a draft by the free software foundation if the document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this license can be used that proxy s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the document 11 relicensing massive multiauthor collaboration site or mmc site means any world wide web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works a public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server a massive multiauthor collaboration or mmc contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the mmc site cc by sa means the creative commons attribution share alike 3 0 license published by creative commons corporation a not for profit corporation with a principal place of business in san francisco california as

"LGPL-2.1","gnu lesser general public license version 2 1 february 1999 copyright copyright 1991 1999 free software foundation inc 51 franklin street fifth floor boston ma 02110 1301 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed this is the first released version of the lesser gpl it also counts as the successor of the gnu library public license version 2 hence the version number 2 1 preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this license the lesser general public license applies to some specially designated software packages typically libraries of the free software foundation and other authors who decide to use it you can use it too but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary general public license is the better strategy to use in any particular case based on the explanations below when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom of use not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs and that you are informed that you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of the library whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code if you link other code with the library you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with a two step method 1 we copyright the library and 2 we offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the library to protect each distributor we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library also if the library is modified by someone else and passed on the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version so that the original author s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others finally software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program we wish to make sure that a company can not effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder therefore we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license most gnu software including some libraries is covered by the ordinary gnu general public license this license the gnu lesser general public license applies to certain designated libraries and is quite different from the ordinary general public license we use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non free programs when a program is linked with a library whether statically or using a shared library the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work a derivative of the original library the ordinary general public license therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom the lesser general public license permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library we call this license the lesser general public license because it does less to protect the user s freedom than the ordinary general public license it also provides other free software developers less of an advantage over competing non free programs these disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary general public license for many libraries however the lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances for example on rare occasions there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library so that it becomes a de facto standard to achieve this non free programs must be allowed to use the library a more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non free libraries in this case there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only so we use the lesser general public license in other cases permission to use a particular library in non free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software for example permission to use the gnu c library in non free programs enables many more people to use the whole gnu operating system as well as its variant the gnu linux operating system although the lesser general public license is less protective of the users freedom it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the library the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow pay close attention to the difference between a work based on the library and a work that uses the library the former contains code derived from the library whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0 this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license also called this license each licensee is addressed as you a library means a collection of software functions and or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs which use some of those functions and data to form executables the library below refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms a work based on the library means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the library or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated straightforwardly into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for a library complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running a program using the library is not restricted and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does 1 you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library s complete source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and distribute a copy of this license along with the library you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee 2 you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the library and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a the modified work must itself be a software library b you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change c you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license d if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that in the event an application does not supply such function or table the facility still operates and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful for example a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well defined independent of the application therefore subsection 2d requires that any application supplied function or table used by this function must be optional if the application does not supply it the square root function must still compute square roots these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library or with a work based on the library on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license 3 you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library to do this you must alter all the notices that refer to this license so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license version 2 instead of to this license if a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared then you can specify that version instead if you wish do not make any other change in these notices once this change is made in a given copy it is irreversible for that copy so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library 4 you may copy and distribute the library or a portion or derivative of it under section 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code 5 a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it is called a work that uses the library such a work in isolation is not a derivative work of the library and therefore falls outside the scope of this license however linking a work that uses the library with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library because it contains portions of the library rather than a work that uses the library the executable is therefore covered by this license section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables when a work that uses the library uses material from a header file that is part of the library the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library or if the work is itself a library the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law if such an object file uses only numerical parameters data structure layouts and accessors and small macros and small inline functions ten lines or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section 6 otherwise if the work is a derivative of the library you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section 6 any executables containing that work also fall under section 6 whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself 6 as an exception to the sections above you may also combine or link a work that uses the library with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library and distribute that work under terms of your choice provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license you must supply a copy of this license if the work during execution displays copyright notices you must include the copyright notice for the library among them as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license also you must do one of these things a accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine readable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work which must be distributed under sections 1 and 2 above and if the work is an executable linked with the library with the complete machine readable work that uses the library as object code and or source code so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions b use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library a suitable mechanism is one that 1 uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user s computer system rather than copying library functions into the executable and 2 will operate properly with a modified version of the library if the user installs one as long as the modified version is interface compatible with the version that the work was made with c accompany the work with a written offer valid for at least three years to give the same user the materials specified in subsection 6a above for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution d if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place e verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy for an executable the required form of the work that uses the library must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it however as a special exception the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system such a contradiction means you can not use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute 7 you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license and distribute such a combined library provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted and provided that you do these two things a accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library uncombined with any other library facilities this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above b give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work 8 you may not copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense link with or distribute the library is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance 9 you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the library or any work based on the library you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the library or works based on it 10 each time you redistribute the library or any work based on the library the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license 11 if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license 12 if the distribution and or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license 13 the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later

"LPPL-1.3a","the latex project public license lppl version 1 3a 2004 10 01 copyright 1999 2002 04 latex3 project everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document but modification of it is not allowed preamble the latex project public license lppl is the primary license under which the the latex kernel and the base latex packages are distributed you may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute this license may be particularly suitable if your work is tex related such as a latex package but you may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated to tex the section whether and how to distribute works under this license below gives instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license this license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed we the latex3 project believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability integrity and reliability of that work if you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions then read the document cfgguide tex and modguide tex in the base latex distribution for suggestions definitions in this license document the following terms are used work any work being distributed under this license derived work any work that under any applicable law is derived from the work modification any procedure that produces a derived work under any applicable law for example the production of a file containing an original file associated with the work or a significant portion of such a file either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language modify to apply any procedure that produces a derived work under any applicable law distribution making copies of the work available from one person to another in whole or in part distribution includes but is not limited to making any electronic components of the work accessible by file transfer protocols such as ftp or http or by shared file systems such as sun s network file system nfs compiled work a version of the work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system this processing may include using installation facilities provided by the work transformations of the work copying of components of the work or other activities note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the work constitutes modification of the work current maintainer a person or persons nominated as such within the work if there is no such explicit nomination then it is the copyright holder under any applicable law base interpreter a program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the work a base interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the base interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the work the only applicable base interpreter is a latex format conditions on distribution and modification 1 activities other than distribution and or modification of the work are not covered by this license they are outside its scope in particular the act of running the work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the work 2 you may distribute a complete unmodified copy of the work as you received it distribution of only part of the work is considered modification of the work and no right to distribute such a derived work may be assumed under the terms of this clause 3 you may distribute a compiled work that has been generated from a complete unmodified copy of the work as distributed under clause 2 above as long as that compiled work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the compiled work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a compiled work directly from the work 4 if you are the current maintainer of the work you may without restriction modify the work thus creating a derived work you may also distribute the derived work without restriction including compiled works generated from the derived work derived works distributed in this manner by the current maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the work 5 if you are not the current maintainer of the work you may modify your copy of the work thus creating a derived work based on the work and compile this derived work thus creating a compiled work based on the derived work 6 if you are not the current maintainer of the work you may distribute a derived work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition only the current maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the work a if a component of this derived work can be a direct replacement for a component of the work when that component is used with the base interpreter then wherever this component of the work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that base interpreter the replacement component of this derived work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that base interpreter b every component of the derived work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the derived work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes c no information in the derived work implies that any persons including but not limited to the authors of the original version of the work provide any support including but not limited to the reporting and handling of errors to recipients of the derived work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the derived work d you distribute at least one of the following with the derived work 1 a complete unmodified copy of the work if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the work from the same or some similar place meets this condition even though third parties are not compelled to copy the work along with the modified component 2 information that is sufficient to obtain a complete unmodified copy of the work 7 if you are not the current maintainer of the work you may distribute a compiled work generated from a derived work as long as the derived work is distributed to all recipients of the compiled work and as long as the conditions of clause 6 above are met with regard to the derived work 8 the conditions above are not intended to prohibit and hence do not apply to the modification by any method of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the work as it is distributed by the current maintainer under clause 4 above 9 distribution of the work or any derived work in an alternative format where the work or that derived work in whole or in part is then produced by applying some process to that format does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process 10 a a derived work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in clause 6 above in regard to the work though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license b if a derived work is distributed under this license that derived work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that derived work to honor the restrictions in clause 6 above concerning changes from the work 11 this license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the work nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the work by any means 12 nothing in this license is intended to or may be used to prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws no warranty there is no warranty for the work except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holder provides the work as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the work is with you should the work prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will the copyright holder or any author named in the components of the work or any other party who may distribute and or modify the work as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the work or out of inability to use the work including but not limited to loss of data data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the work to operate with any other programs even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages maintenance of the work the work has the status author maintained if the copyright holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the work that the work can only be maintained by the copyright holder or simply that is author maintained the work has the status maintained if there is a current maintainer who has indicated in the work that they are willing to receive error reports for the work for example by supplying a valid e mail address it is not required for the current maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports the work changes from status maintained to unmaintained if there is no current maintainer or the person stated to be current maintainer of the work can not be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance you can become the current maintainer of the work by agreement with any existing current maintainer to take over this role if the work is unmaintained you can become the current maintainer of the work through the following steps 1 make a reasonable attempt to trace the current maintainer and the copyright holder if the two differ through the means of an internet or similar search 2 if this search is successful then enquire whether the work is still maintained a if it is being maintained then ask the current maintainer to update their communication data within one month b if the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the current maintainer then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance if the work is a latex work this could be done for example by posting to comp text tex 3a if the current maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the work to you then this takes effect immediately upon announcement b if the current maintainer is not reachable and the copyright holder agrees that maintenance of the work be passed to you then this takes effect immediately upon announcement 4 if you make an intention announcement as described in 2b above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the current maintainer nor by the copyright holder nor by other people then you may arrange for the work to be changed so as to name you as the new current maintainer 5 if the previously unreachable current maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b or 4 then that current maintainer must become or remain the current maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month a change in the current maintainer does not of itself alter the fact that the work is distributed under the lppl license if you become the current maintainer of the work you should immediately provide within the work a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as current maintainer you should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b above whether and how to distribute works under this license this section contains important instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license these authors are addressed as you in this section choosing this license or another license if for any part of your work you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ significantly from those in this license then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but instead distribute your work under a different license you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the lppl the document modguide tex in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license it explains for example why distributing latex under the gnu general public license gpl was considered inappropriate even if your work is unrelated to latex the discussion in modguide tex may still be relevant and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it a recommendation on modification without distribution it is wise never to modify a component of the work even for your own personal use without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component while you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed often this will happen by accident you may forget that you have modified that component or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and worse cause problems for the community it is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the work identical with the public one many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components how to use this license to use this license place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and or last substantially modified include also a statement that the distribution and or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license here is an example of such a notice and statement pig dtx copyright 2003 m y name this work may be distributed and or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license either version 1 3 of this license or at your option any later version the latest version of this license is in http www latex project org lppl txt and version 1 3 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 2003 12 01 or later this work has the lppl maintenance status maintained this current maintainer of this work is m y name this work consists of the files pig dtx and pig ins and the derived file pig sty given such a notice and statement in a file the conditions given in this license document would apply with the work referring to the three files pig dtx pig ins and pig sty the last being generated from pig dtx using pig ins the base interpreter referring to any latex format and both copyright holder and current maintainer referring to the person m y name if you do not want the maintenance section of lppl to apply to your work change maintained above into author maintained however we recommend that you use maintained as the maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself important recommendations defining what constitutes the work the lppl requires that distributions of the work contain all the files of the work it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the work this could for example be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as this work consists of all files listed in manifest txt in that place in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the work and in such a case the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the work"

"LPPL-1.1","the latex project public license lppl version 1 1 1999 07 10 copyright 1999 latex3 project everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document but modification of it is not allowed preamble the latex project public license lppl is the license under which the base latex distribution is distributed you may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to distribute this license may be particularly suitable if your program is tex related such as a latex package but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to tex the section whether and how to distribute programs under this license below gives instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license in this license document the program refers to any program distributed under this license this license gives conditions under which the program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of the program may be distributed individual files of the program may bear supplementary and or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves but no file of the program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file a distributor wishing to distribute a complete unmodified copy of the program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else activities other than distribution and or modification of the program are not covered by this license they are outside its scope in particular the act of running the program is not restricted we the latex3 project believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of the program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability integrity and reliability of the program if you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions then read the document cfgguide tex in the base latex distribution for suggestions conditions on distribution and modification you may distribute a complete unmodified copy of the program distribution of only part of the program is not allowed you may not modify in any way a file of the program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file you may distribute a modified file of the program if and only if the following eight conditions are met 1 you must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection additional conditions on individual files of the program 2 if the file is a latex software file then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection additional conditions on latex software files 3 you must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file 4 in the modified file you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file and the name if any of the program which contains it 5 you must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of the program 6 you must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in the program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files 7 you must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file 8 you must do either a or b a distribute a copy of the program that is a complete unmodified copy of the program together with the modified file if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the program from the same place meets this condition even though third parties are not compelled to copy the program along with the modified file b provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of the program for example you may provide a uniform resource locator url for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of the program free of charge either the version from which your modification is derived or perhaps a later version note that in the above distribution of a file means making the file available to others by any means this includes for instance installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself modification of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law that is a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file the distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions note however that condition 7 does apply to any such modified file the conditions above are not intended to prohibit and hence do not apply to the updating by any method of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of the program a recommendation on modification without distribution it is wise never to modify a file of the program even for your own personal use without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file while you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed often this will happen by accident you may forget that you have modified the file or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license it is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the program identical with the public one many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files additional conditions on individual files of the program an individual file of the program may bear additional conditions that supplement and or supersede the conditions in this license if and only if such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file the conditions on individual files of the program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files additional conditions on latex software files if a file of the program is intended to be used with latex that is if it is a latex software file then the following additional conditions which supplement and or supersede the conditions above apply to the file according to its filename extension you may not modify any file with filename extension ins since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension fd latex font definition files under the standard conditions of the lppl as described above you may also distribute such modified latex font definition files with their original names provided that 1 the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts 2 you also distribute the original unmodified files tex input paths can be used to control which set of latex font definition files is actually used by tex you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension cfg configuration files with their original names the program may and usually will specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file because of portability and exchangeability issues in latex software the latex3 project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of latex or of generally available contributed code for them but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license no warranty there is no warranty for the program except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holder provides the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless agreed to in writing will the copyright holder or any author named in the files of the program or any other party who may distribute and or modify the program as permitted below be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the program or out of inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages whether and how to distribute programs under this license this section contains important instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license these authors are addressed as you in this section choosing this license or another license if for any part of your program you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ from those in this license then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the lppl the document modguide tex in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license it explains for example why distributing latex under the gnu general public license gpl was considered inappropriate even if your program is unrelated to latex the discussion in modguide tex may still be relevant and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it how to use this license to use this license place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license here is an example of such a notice and statement pig dtx copyright 2001 m y name this program may be distributed and or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license either version 1 1 of this license or at your option any later version the latest version of this license is in http www latex project org lppl txt and version 1 1 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 1999 06 01 or later this program consists of the files pig dtx and pig ins given such a notice and statement in a file the conditions given in this license document would apply with the program referring to the two files pig dtx and pig ins and the copyright holder referring to the person m y name important recommendations defining what constitutes the program the lppl requires that distributions of the program contain all the files of the program it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the program this could for example be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like this program consists of all files listed in manifest txt in that place in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the program noting exceptional files if the program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification or on distribution of modified versions of those files other than those listed in additional conditions on latex software files then it is recommended that the program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files files containing the text of a license such as this file are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification latex configuration files with filename extension cfg are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file the additional conditions on latex software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions"

"RPL-1.5","reciprocal public license rpl version 1 5 july 15 2007 copyright copyright 2001 2007 technical pursuit inc all rights reserved preamble the reciprocal public license rpl is based on the concept of reciprocity or if you prefer fairness in short this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them this occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a third party while there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing it struck the authors of the rpl as being unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular after all bug fixes extensions and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further and faster growth and expansion of the overall open source software base while you should clearly read and understand the entire license the essence of the rpl is found in two definitions deploy and required components regarding deployment under the rpl your changes bug fixes extensions etc must be made available to the open source community at large when you deploy in any form either internally or to an outside party once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software further under the rpl all components you author including schemas scripts source code etc regardless of whether they re compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client server application must be shared you have to share the whole pie not an isolated slice of it in addition to these

"LPPL-1.2","the latex project public license lppl version 1 2 1999 09 03 copyright 1999 latex3 project everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document but modification of it is not allowed preamble the latex project public license lppl is the license under which the base latex distribution is distributed you may use this license for any program that you have written and wish to distribute this license may be particularly suitable if your program is tex related such as a latex package but you may use it even if your program is unrelated to tex the section whether and how to distribute programs under this license below gives instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license in this license document the program refers to any program distributed under this license this license gives conditions under which the program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of the program may be distributed individual files of the program may bear supplementary and or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves but no file of the program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file a distributor wishing to distribute a complete unmodified copy of the program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else activities other than distribution and or modification of the program are not covered by this license they are outside its scope in particular the act of running the program is not restricted we the latex3 project believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of the program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability integrity and reliability of the program if you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions then read the document cfgguide tex in the base latex distribution for suggestions conditions on distribution and modification you may distribute a complete unmodified copy of the program distribution of only part of the program is not allowed you may not modify in any way a file of the program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file you may distribute a modified file of the program if and only if the following eight conditions are met 1 you must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection additional conditions on individual files of the program 2 if the file is a latex software file then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection additional conditions on latex software files 3 you must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file 4 in the modified file you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file and the name if any of the program which contains it 5 you must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of the program 6 you must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in the program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files 7 you must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file 8 you must do either a or b a distribute a copy of the program that is a complete unmodified copy of the program together with the modified file if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the program from the same place meets this condition even though third parties are not compelled to copy the program along with the modified file b provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of the program for example you may provide a uniform resource locator url for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of the program free of charge either the version from which your modification is derived or perhaps a later version note that in the above distribution of a file means making the file available to others by any means this includes for instance installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself modification of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law that is a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language changing the name of a file other than as necessitated by the file conventions of the target file systems is considered to be a modification of the file the distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions note however that condition 7 does apply to any such modified file the conditions above are not intended to prohibit and hence do not apply to the updating by any method of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of the program a recommendation on modification without distribution it is wise never to modify a file of the program even for your own personal use without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file while you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed often this will happen by accident you may forget that you have modified the file or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license it is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the program identical with the public one many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files additional conditions on individual files of the program an individual file of the program may bear additional conditions that supplement and or supersede the conditions in this license if and only if such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file the conditions on individual files of the program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files additional conditions on latex software files if a file of the program is intended to be used with latex that is if it is a latex software file then the following additional conditions which supplement and or supersede the conditions above apply to the file according to its filename extension you may not modify any file with filename extension ins since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension fd latex font definition files under the standard conditions of the lppl as described above you may also distribute such modified latex font definition files with their original names provided that 1 the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts 2 you also distribute the original unmodified files tex input paths can be used to control which set of latex font definition files is actually used by tex you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension cfg configuration files with their original names the program may and usually will specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file because of portability and exchangeability issues in latex software the latex3 project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of latex or of generally available contributed code for them but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license no warranty there is no warranty for the program except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holder provides the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction in no event unless agreed to in writing will the copyright holder or any author named in the files of the program or any other party who may distribute and or modify the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the program or out of inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages whether and how to distribute programs under this license this section contains important instructions examples and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license these authors are addressed as you in this section choosing this license or another license if for any part of your program you want or need to use distribution conditions that differ from those in this license then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the lppl the document modguide tex in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license it explains for example why distributing latex under the gnu general public license gpl was considered inappropriate even if your program is unrelated to latex the discussion in modguide tex may still be relevant and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it how to use this license to use this license place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license here is an example of such a notice and statement pig dtx copyright 2001 m y name this program may be distributed and or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license either version 1 2 of this license or at your option any later version the latest version of this license is in http www latex project org lppl txt and version 1 2 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 1999 12 01 or later this program consists of the files pig dtx and pig ins given such a notice and statement in a file the conditions given in this license document would apply with the program referring to the two files pig dtx and pig ins and the copyright holder referring to the person m y name important recommendations defining what constitutes the program the lppl requires that distributions of the program contain all the files of the program it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the program this could for example be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like this program consists of all files listed in manifest txt in that place in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the program noting exceptional files if the program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification or on distribution of modified versions of those files other than those listed in additional conditions on latex software files then it is recommended that the program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files files containing the text of a license such as this file are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification latex configuration files with filename extension cfg are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file the additional conditions on latex software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions"

sense of freedom to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it with or without modifying it either commercially or noncommercially secondarily this license preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others this license is a kind of copyleft which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense it complements the gnu general public license which is a copyleft license designed for free software we have designed this license in order to use it for manuals for free software because free software needs free documentation a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does but this license is not limited to software manuals it can be used for any textual work regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book we recommend this license principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference 1 applicability and definitions this license applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this license the document below refers to any such manual or work any member of the public is a licensee and is addressed as you a modified version of the document means any work containing the document or a portion of it either copied verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language a secondary section is a named appendix or a front matter section of the document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the document to the document s overall subject or to related matters and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject for example if the document is in part a textbook of mathematics a secondary section may not explain any mathematics the relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters or of legal commercial philosophical ethical or political position regarding them the invariant sections are certain secondary sections whose titles are designated as being those of invariant sections in the notice that says that the document is released under this license the cover texts are certain short passages of text that are listed as front cover texts or back cover texts in the notice that says that the document is released under this license a transparent copy of the document means a machine readable copy represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or for images composed of pixels generic paint programs or for drawings some widely available drawing editor and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters a copy made in an otherwise transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not transparent a copy that is not transparent is called opaque examples of suitable formats for transparent copies include plain ascii without markup texinfo input format latex input format sgml or xml using a publicly available dtd and standard conforming simple html designed for human modification opaque formats include postscript pdf proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors sgml or xml for which the dtd and or processing tools are not generally available and the machine generated html produced by some word processors for output purposes only the title page means for a printed book the title page itself plus such following pages as are needed to hold legibly the material this license requires to appear in the title page for works in formats which do not have any title page as such title page means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work s title preceding the beginning of the body of the text 2 verbatim copying you may copy and distribute the document in

the covers in addition copying with changes limited to the covers as long as they preserve the title of the document and satisfy these conditions can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects if the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly you should put the first ones listed as many as fit reasonably on the actual cover and continue the rest onto adjacent pages if you publish or distribute opaque copies of the document numbering more than 100 you must either include a machine readable transparent copy along with each opaque copy or state in or with each opaque copy a publicly accessible computer network location containing a complete transparent copy of the document free of added material which the general network using public has access to download

itself is political namely to compliment the software s intended political function hacktivismo itself exists to develop and deploy computer software technologies that promote fundamental human rights of end users hacktivismo also seeks to enlist the active participation and involvement of people around the world to help us improve these software tools and to take other actions including actions that involve using and distributing our software and the advancement of similarly minded software projects of others that promote human rights and freedom worldwide fn1 http hacktivismo com because of our non commercial objective of promoting end users freedoms hacktivismo has some special and admittedly ambitious licensing needs this license agreement enhances the benefits of published source code

journalists and religious figures is seldom if ever justified by any legitimate governmental objective and to the extent that technology enables censorship decisions to be removed from public scrutiny

authenticity and or trust fn10 article 12 universal declaration of human rights reasons for enhancing free and open source licensing developing a new software license is never a trivial task and this license agreement has presented special challenges for hacktivismo because of our human rights objectives this license agreement includes some specific terms and conditions that as a technical matter depart from the previously recognized and established definitions of free fn11 software and open source fn12 software fn11 http www gnu org philosophy free sw html fn12 http www opensource org docs definition plain php we have therefore coined the term enhanced source to describe this license agreement because we have sought to combine most of the freedom promoting benefits of free or open source software including mandatory disclosure of any changes or modifications licensees make to the source code whenever they release modified versions of hessla licensed programs or other derivative works with additional enhanced license and contractual terms that are intended to promote the freedom of end users the hacktivismo enhanced source software license agreement promotes our objectives in an enhanced manner by including contractual terms that empower both hacktivismo and qualified end users with greater flexibility and leverage to maintain and recover human rights through the mechanism of the contract itself including terms that are designed to enhance both our enforcement posture and that of qualified end users in court to be sure hacktivismo enthusiastically endorses and supports the goals and objectives of the free software movement and those of the open source community in particular we owe a special debt of gratitude to the free software foundation to the open source initiative and to many exceedingly talented people who have contributed to free software and open source projects and endeavors over the years ultimately however after reviewing the field of possibilities among previously existing open source and free licenses hacktivismo has concluded that none of them fully meets our requirements writing our own license agreement enables us to pursue our human rights objectives more effectively this licensing endeavor represents a first step toward achieving our objectives and no doubt informed feedback scholarship and learned commentary will enable us to pursue our objectives even more effectively in the future benefits that carry over from free software before we explain how an enhanced source license agreement specifically differs from a free or open source license we believe it is helpful to explain in greater detail what the principal advantages and freedom enhancing aspects of free software are when we speak of free software we refer to important personal freedoms and not price in addition to terms that are intended to promote the freedoms of expression thought collective action and privacy along with other human rights of all end users the hacktivismo enhanced source software license agreement is also designed and intended to promote the following freedoms · you have the freedom to distribute copies of the software and charge for this service if you wish · you have the freedom of access to the source code to inspect and verify and even to improve if you can the integrity and functionality of the software · so long as you do not subvert or infringe the freedoms of end users by doing so you have the freedom to change the software or to use parts of it in new programs · you have the freedom to know you can do these things the licenses for most computer software programs are designed to take away your freedom to share software or change source code this kind of software is designated as proprietary or closed the hacktivismo enhanced source software license agreement like other license agreements that have served as inspiration for our work is intended to promote both your freedom to share our software with others and your freedom to change and improve the software your right under this license agreement to look at the source not only enables you to contribute your own efforts to hacktivismo s human rights projects but also serves as an additional level of assurance to you as an end user that unwelcome hidden surprises have not been inserted into the software that could compromise your rights and freedoms when you use the software hessla helps safeguard additional end user freedoms in order to understand why this license agreement must be described as enhanced source and can not strictly speaking be considered either a free or open source license agreement it is helpful to consider the possibility that a programmer might insert malicious code such as a computer virus a keystroke logger or spyware into a program that has previously been released under a free software license agreement fn13 the act of inserting malicious code into software if done by a private individual or company though many governments will contend they are not required to play by the same rules as the rest of us may well violate criminal laws and result in civil tort liability it is of course also possible to deter such malicious behavior by including in a software license agreement a specific contractual term that prohibits such behavior meaning that any licensee who violates the prohibition against malicious code can be sued by the licensor or by third party beneficiaries who the licensor has explicitly identified as alternate or additional enforcers of the agreement for money damages and a court order forbidding any continued violation fn13 in this regard a the following hypothetical illustration should be particularly helpful if an organization of computer security enthusiasts were to release under the gnu general public license gpl a program called grey eminence 3000 ge3k a remote administration tool for microsoft windows that helps illustrate how insecure this particular commercial product happens to be it should hardly be surprising that the united states secret service and federal bureau of investigation after making some loud and misleading apocalyptic noises about computer hackers to congress and in the media primarily in a largely successful effort to increase their technology budgets would also study the software to see what it does how it does it and whether any of those capabilities happen to be features that law enforcement might find helpful of course if the u s federal law enforcement community were to announce several months later that it had commissioned the development of classified quasi viral computer intrusion and surveillance software called magic candle the capabilities of which law enforcement does not plan to disclose to the public and the source code for which will remain a closely guarded secret then inquiring minds might become curious as to whether magic candle contains any of the gpled code that was written for ge3k or any other free or open source software for that matter needless to say under the right factual circumstances if any gpled code from ge3k found its way into magic candle then the u s government or its software development contractor might well be obligated to reveal to the public all the source code for magic candle nevertheless so long as the magic candle source is never publicly released for comparison purposes then everyone with legitimate questions about gpl compliance faces a chicken and egg problem so long as the source of magic candle remains secret detection of a gpl violation becomes dramatically more difficult particularly so if additionally nobody outside law enforcement has access to the compiled executables which means the worldwide community of internet users and software developers has only the united states government s solemn assurance that no ge3k code was used cold comfort at best previous licenses provide more limited protection against government and other surveillance no software license agreement that qualifies as free or open source may contain any restriction as a term of the license agreement that in any way qualifies any licensee s prerogative no matter who they are or what their motives may be to make changes to code in other words an open source license agreement to qualify for the open source label may not even contain a term that prohibits the insertion of destructive viruses or trojan horses into derivative code likewise no free or open source license agreement can in any way contain as a license term any restriction on the use of software not even a prohibition against unlawful surveillance or other malicious uses of the software the open source and free software communities rely principally on voluntary compliance fn14 with the disclosure provisions of license agreements although many free and open source license agreements such as bsd style licenses do not require changed code to be disclosed and in fact enable modified versions of programs to be taken proprietary and on social mechanisms of enforcement as means to detect prevent deter and remedy abuses fn14 as the example in note 13 illustrates it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the source disclosure requirement of the gpl has been violated such as when a modified version of a program has been distributed without source precisely because detection of a disclosure violation depends in part on the disclosure of the source of derivative works in order to compare whether a putative derivative really does contain code derived from a gpled parent work the hacktivismo enhanced source software license agreement does not in any way sacrifice or surrender the enforcement techniques and safeguards available under license agreements such as the gnu general public license rather the hessla enhances the options available to hacktivismo and to qualified end users by providing additional enforcement options moreover for the purpose of promoting the freedoms of both programers and end users through the enforced mandatory disclosure of code modified by third parties this license agreement has advantages over many of the licenses such as bsd style licenses that fully qualify as free or open source license agreements what makes this license agreement an enhanced source license agreement instead of a free software license agreement is that the hacktivismo enhanced source software license agreement contains specific very limited restrictions on modification and use of software by licensees as part of a calculated trade off of rights and responsibilities that is intended to promote the freedom of end users the enhanced source bargain reinforces end user freedoms to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you specific rights or to ask you to surrender these rights to protect your human rights as an end user of this program or any work based on it we need to make restrictions that forbid you and all other licensees of this software including without limitation any government licensees from using this code to subvert the human rights of any end user we protect your rights and the rights of all end users with two steps 1 copyright the software and 2 offer you this license agreement which gives you qualified legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software the restrictions shared by all licensees translate into certain responsibilities for you and for everyone else including governmental entities everywhere if you distribute copies of the software if you use it or if you modify it in this regard the methodology we employ is not materially different from the methodology free software foundation employs in the gnu general public license the gpl the methodology is to exchange the author s permission to copy change and or distribute a copyrighted work for every licensee s acceptance of terms and conditions that promote the licensor s objectives in both this license agreement and the gpl the terms and conditions that each licensee must accept are intended to discriminate against certain very narrow limited kinds of human endeavor that are inconsistent with the licensor s political objectives in other words the gpl requires each licensee to promise not to engage in the activity of propertizing or taking proprietary modifications to gpled code modified code must also be released under the gpl and can not be released in the form of closed executables or otherwise be made proprietary likewise the hacktivismo enhanced source software license agreement discriminates against undesirable activity such as surveillance introduction of certain kinds of malicious code and human rights violations as well as discriminating against propertizing behavior such as might violate the gpl subject to these narrow restrictions licensees under either license agreement enjoy very broad latitude to change use explore modify and distribute the software much broader than they would enjoy with typical proprietary software packages as with copyleft licenses such as the gpl under the hacktivismo enhanced source software license agreement programmers including most importantly programmers working for governments do not have unfettered or completely unlimited freedom for purposes of what they can do with hessla licensed code just as with the gpl they do not have the freedom to convert hessla licensed code into closed or proprietary code people who create derivative works based on an hessla licensed program and distribute those works have a corresponding obligation to give back and not merely to take hessla licensed code if you distribute copies of such an hessla licensed program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights and responsibilities that you have you must ensure that they too are told of the terms of this license agreement including the freedoms they have and the kinds of uses and modifications that are forbidden you must communicate a copy of this license agreement to them as part of any copy modification or re use of source or object code so they know their rights and responsibilities thus the main difference between this license agreement and the gpl is not the methodology we employ fn15 but the scope and breadth of the political objectives we seek to promote simply put the political objectives we promote are somewhat broader than the explicit political goals that the free software foundation seeks to promote through the gpl our goals include a somewhat broader range of human rights than the specific copyright related rights with which the gpl is principally concerned but while we are concerned with the entire field of human rights rather than a subset we want to make it perfectly clear that we also embrace share and seek to promote the goals we share with the free software movement fn15 there is a modest difference but it is not large and mostly philosophical some experts on the gpl draw a distinction between a contract and a pure license by taking the position that a pure license does not impose contractual conditions on a licensee only conditions that would otherwise but for the license be subsumed within with exclusive rights that the licensor has under copyright law thus the licensor has the right to exclude anyone else from such activities as making copies making derivative works publicly performing a work and other exclusive rights specified by statute but concerning the act of using a computer software program in instances in which a copy is not made or in the trivial sense that a copy is made only temporarily from a storage medium to memory to enable software to be used the free software foundation takes the position that united states law at least does not confer an exclusive right on the copyright holder or as others would argue the united states statute qualifies the holder s exclusive right to copy because the u s copyright act specifically exempts from the exclusive right to make copies a copy made from for example a computer hard drive to volatile memory in connection with the process of executing computer software so far as we can determine the free software foundation does not argue that it is impossible contractually to impose conditions on use as part of the bargain one strikes when conditionally allowing licensees to make copies of a program rather for philosophical reasons the free software foundation voluntarily chooses not to include what it views as contractual conditions in the gpl in this sense hactivismo takes the position that the hessla is clearly a contract and contains contractual terms such that it should not be considered a pure license under the nomenclature employed by the free software foundation however in our view precisely because both the hessla and the gpl are clearly conditional grants of permission to do things from which the licensee would otherwise be excluded i e the licensee must undertake certain obligations in exchange for permission to copy modify or distribute a work the key point is that the methodology is quite similar compared with the gpl aspects of the hessla give both end users and programmers including most importantly governmental end users and programmers marginally less leeway to make malicious use of the program or to insert malicious code into a program than they would have under a traditional copyleft software license these aspects of the hessla such as the requirement that the program can not be used to violate human rights or forbidding the insertion of spy ware or surveillance mechanisms into derivative works are included because our ultimate objective is to preserve and promote the human rights of end users including their privacy and their right of free expression in other words unlike many programmers we are not just in the business of developing and distributing open standards technologies we re also trying to empower end users including end users in totalitarian regimes with software tools that promote fundamental freedoms while also seeking as best we can to protect these end users from being arrested beaten or worse our objective of promoting end user freedoms including the freedoms of people in politically repressive countries is precisely the factor that has led hacktivismo to develop this license agreement instead of using another the hessla also includes features to enhance government accountability to this end we have sought and intend to ensure to the fullest extent that law including without limitation the law of contract and of copyright licensing enables us to do so fn16 that no government or other institution may do anything with this computer software or the underlying source code without becoming a licensee bound by the terms of this license agreement subject to the same restrictions on modification and use as anyone else fn16 everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating fundamental rights article 8 united nations declaration of human rights accordingly this license agreement includes several terms that are aimed explicitly at governmental entities in order to maximize enforceability against such entities respect for the rule of law means that no governmental entity is above the law and that no governmental entity should be permitted to use its status as a mechanism for circumventing the requirements of this license agreement any use copying or modification of this software by any governmental official or governmental entity anywhere in the world is a voluntary act which act the governmental official or entity is free to forego if it does not wish to be bound by this license agreement this license agreement seeks to establish as clearly as possible two important checks on the improper use of government power first the voluntary election to use copy or modify this software by any government or governmental official constitutes a waiver of all immunities that might otherwise be asserted against enforcement of this license agreement by the author or assertion by end users or others of any human rights laws that may have been violated by a government employing the software second any such government or governmental official not only subjects itself to enforcement action in its own courts but also explicitly and voluntarily subjects itself to enforcement action in the courts of other nations that are likely to be more objective for the purpose of giving effect to the terms of this license agreement mechanism of contract acceptance this license agreement treats any use of the software as acceptance of the terms of this license agreement to understand the significance of this it is important to distinguish between the law governing copyright and the law governing offer and acceptance for the purpose of contract formation which gives the offeror the power to specify the manner of acceptance the question of whether copyright confers an exclusive right of use on the author of a program is certainly an interesting one under united states law see 17 u s c  117 a 1 a limited exception to the exclusive right to copy exists if one makes a second copy created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner this license agreement presupposes that there is no exclusive right to use in the copyright act just an exclusive right to copy however you may not make a copy for anyone else unless they are subject to the terms of this license agreement nor may you permit anyone to use your copy or any other copy you have made unless they are subject to the terms of this license agreement you may not make a copy for your own use or the use of anyone else without the author s leave to make that copy and any use modification copying or distribution by anyone constitutes acceptance of the license agreement for purposes of contract law in other words the license agreement is designed so that there is no loophole permitting anyone to claim the ability to use copy distribute or modify the program or any software based on it without subjecting themselves voluntarily to its terms on shrinkwrap click wrap use wrap and copy wrap license agreements arguably some kinds of software license agreements have more in common with legislation than they do with the bargained for negotiated agreements that come to mind when most people think of contracts particularly if a software licensor has sufficient market power to be deemed a monopoly or if certain proposed expansions of the law of software licensing masquerading as codifications are widely adopted the ability of a private entity to impose legal prohibitions and duties on virtually everyone else as though the licensor has assumed powers that customarily belong to legislative bodies is both breathtaking and deeply troubling of course we are hardly the first to distribute software under a license agreement that imposes conditions on a take it or leave it basis this technique is as everyone knows extremely common with proprietary software and some of the conditions unilaterally imposed by proprietary licensors range from the ridiculous to the obscene but even certain kinds of free and open source software licenses such as the gpl depend on the continued viability of legal rules that enable at least some reasonable conditions to be imposed by software licensors on a take it or leave it basis with essentially automated methods of acceptance courts have been divided as to how far these kinds of licensor driven automated agreements can go and we can not say that we will be unhappy if courts or legislatures ultimately reach a consensus that sharply limits what conditions licensors can impose through such mechanisms however while the law is still developing we think nothing could be more appropriate than to enlist the techniques that institutions of power have used to limit freedom and instead to re purpose the techniques of copy wrap or use wrap licensing by putting them to use for humanitarian purposes and using them to promote the human rights of end users to deny us the use of these techniques courts and other law making institutions would be required simultaneously to disarm to the same degree proprietary software manufacturers that possess vast market power and unlike the conditions imposed by many proprietary vendors the conditions we impose through this license agreement are hardly onerous for any end user unless of course the end user wants to act maliciously or engage in surveillance no warranty next for each author s protection and our own we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this software and if the software is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations software patents software patents constantly threaten any project such as this one we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a hessla licensed program will individually obtain patent licenses in effect making the program proprietary to prevent this we have included terms by which any author must if it has patented or licensed a patent covering any technology embodied in any program or software released under this license agreement grant all hessla licensees of the program or software a royalty free license of that technology any licensees who release derivative works as permitted by this license agreement are required to grant a royalty free patent license of any patented technology anyone can release original software under the hessla although this license agreement is drafted with hacktivismo s objectives in mind perhaps it will meet other authors needs as well if you are considering using this license agreement for your own software meaning the code is not a work based on hacktivismo s program in which case all derivative works must be released under this license agreement but rather your code is original software that you have developed yourself and if you have no special reason to prefer this license agreement to some license that has a more robust and widely understood track record then in most instances we encourage you to use the gpl or even better release concurrently under both the hessla and the gpl because a considerable body of interpretive literature and community custom has grown up around that license agreement the open software license see http www rosenlaw com osl html is newer and has less of a track record but you may also want to consider that licensing option as well as the option of concurrent osl hessla licensing any author of original software can release that software under this license agreement if you choose to do so not just hacktivismo hacktivismo is the author and owner of software released by hacktivismo under this license agreement but original software released by other authors would be owned and licensed by them ultimately we think it is important to emphasize to other authors that programs they have written can be released under both the hessla and some other license simultaneously for example a program that is presently gpled by its author can be released simultaneously under both the gpl and the hessla at the author s discretion if you are an author of original work you need neither the permission of the free software foundation nor of hacktivismo to elect to release software simultaneously under both licenses the advantage of such a voluntary double licensing is that it will enable developers to produce hybrid software packages combining the functionality available through say hacktivismo s six four apis with some of the functionality of one or more popular gpl licensed communications programs and to release the hybrid packages under the hessla without causing those developers to run afoul of the gpl the hessla or both such an arrangement maximizes the potential benefit to both the developer community and to end users worldwide software released under a bsd style license as a general matter can be used to produce a hybrid program mixing hessla licensed code with code that was previously subject to a bsd license the hessla requires that in such an instance the hybrid code must be released under the hessla to avoid weakening the end user protections and affirmative rights afforded by the hessla hacktivismo is more than happy to consult with any software developer about the license terms that should apply to any software that is derivative of any program of which hacktivismo is author if another author has released code under the hessla then that author has primary decision making authority about the manner in which his her or its software is licensed but hacktivismo is happy to field any questions hat may be posed by such an author or by any developer who is building on another author s hesslaed code license revisions this license agreement is subject to revision prior to the release of the hacktivismo enhanced source software license agreement version 1 0 we invite interested parties from the international academic and legal communities to offer comments and suggestions on ways to improve this license agreement prior to the time that the hessla version 1 0 is released the terms of the latest and most up to date version of this license agreement up to and including version 1 0 shall be deemed automatically to supersede the terms of any lower numbered version of this license agreement with respect to any licensee who became a licensee under the lower numbered version of the hessla the terms of the latest and most up to date version of this license agreement will always be published on the hacktivismo website http www hacktivismo com the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution use and modification follow terms and conditions for copying distribution use and or modification 0 definitions the following are defined terms that whenever used in this license agreement have the following meanings 0 1 author author shall mean the copyright holder of an original work the program released by the author under this license agreement 0 2 copy copy shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a copy according to copyright law without limitation a copy does not become anything other than a copy merely because for example a governmental or institutional employee duplicates the program or a part of it for another employee of the same institution or governmental entity or merely because it is copied from one computer to another or from one medium to another or multiple copies are made on the same medium within the same institutional or governmental entity 0 3 derivative work a derivative work or work based on the program shall mean either the program itself or any work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification in the unlikely event that and to the extent that this contractual definition of derivative work is later determined by any tribunal or dispute resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of derivative work under the copyright law of any country then the broadest and most encompassing possible definition either the contractual definition of derivative work or any broader and more encompassing statutory or legal definition shall control acceptance of this contractually defined scope of the term derivative work is a mandatory pre condition for you to receive any of the benefits offered by this license agreement 0 3 1 mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a derivative work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license agreement 0 4 license agreement when used in this license agreement the terms this license or this license agreement shall mean the hactivismo enhanced source software license agreement v 0 1 or any subsequent version made applicable under the terms of section 15 0 5 licensee the term licensee shall mean you or any other licensee whether or not a qualified licensee 0 6 original work original work shall mean a program or other work of authorship or portion thereof that is not a derivative work 0 7 program the program to which this license agreement applies is the original work including but not limited to computer software released by the author under this license agreement 0 8 qualified licensee a qualified licensee means a licensee that remains in full compliance with all terms and conditions of this license agreement you are no longer a qualified licensee if at any time you violate any terms of this license agreement neither the program nor any software based on the program may be copied distributed performed displayed used or modified by you even for your own purposes unless you are a qualified licensee a licensee other than a qualified licensee remains subject to all terms and conditions of this license agreement and to all remedies for each cumulative violation as set forth herein loss of the status of qualified licensee signifies that violation of any terms of the license agreement subjects a licensee to loss of most of the benefits that qualified licensees enjoy under this license agreement and to additional remedies for all violations occurring after the first violation 0 9 software software or the software shall mean the program any derivative work based on the program or a portion thereof and or any modified version of the program or portion thereof without limitation 0 10 source code the term source code shall mean the preferred form of a program or original work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to access and modify that program or original work 0 10 1 for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable 0 10 2 object code because of certain peculiarities of current export control rules object code of the program or any modified version of the program or derivative work based on the program must not be exported except by way of distribution that is ancillary to the distribution of the source code the source code shall be understood as the primary content transferred or exported by you and the object code shall be considered as merely an ancillary component of any such export distribution 0 11 strong cryptography strong cryptography shall mean cryptography no less secure than for example and without limitation a 2048 bit minimum key size for rsa encryption 1024 bit minimum key size for diffie hellman el gamal or a 256 bit minimum key size for aes and similar symmetric ciphers 0 12 substandard key selection technique the term substandard key selection technique shall mean a method or technique to cause encryption keys to be more easily guessed or less secure such as by i causing the selection of keys to be less than random or ii employing a selection process that selects among only a subset of possible keys instead of from among the largest set of possible keys that can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about the cryptographic techniques employed by you the following illustrations elaborate on the foregoing definition 0 12 1 if the key generation or key selection technique for the encryption algorithm you employ involves the selection of one or more prime numbers or involves one or more mathematical functions or concatenations performed on one or more prime numbers then each prime number should be selected from a very large set of candidate prime numbers but not necessarily from the set of all possible prime numbers e g inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set for example may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security and absolutely not from any artificially small set of candidate primes that makes the guessing of a key easier than would be the case if a secure key generation technique were employed in all instances the primes should be selected at random from among the candidate set if there is a customary industry standard for maximizing the security associated with the key generation or key selection technique for the cryptosystem you select then with attention also to the requirements of section 0 11 you should employ a key generation or selection technique no less secure than the customary industry standard for secure use of the cryptosystem 0 12 2 if the key generation or key selection technique for the encryption algorithm you employ involves the selection of a random integer or the transformation of a random integer through one or more mathematical processes then the selection of the integer shall be at random from the largest possible set of all possible integers consistent with the secure functioning of the encryption algorithm it shall not be selected from an artificially small set of integers e g if a 256 bit random integer serves as the key then you could not set 200 of the 256 bits as 0 and randomly generate only the remaining 56 bits producing effectively a 56 bit keylength instead of using the full 256 bits 0 12 3 in other words your key generation technique must promote security to the maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic method s and keylength you elect to employ rather than facilitating eavesdropping or surveillance in any way the example of gsm telephones in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set at 0 thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of 65 536 is particularly salient such artificial techniques to reduce the security of a cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a less secure or suboptimal subset of possible keys is prohibited and will violate this license agreement if any such technique is employed in any software 0 13 you each licensee including without limitation licensees that have violated the license agreement and who are no longer qualified licensees but who nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of this license agreement and to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation is referred to as you 0 13 1 governmental entity you explicitly includes any and all governmental entities without limitation

copy the software however for purposes of contract law any use of the software shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this license agreement moreover all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of a copy has accepted the license agreement because each such recipient licensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access use or secure a copy of the software without first accepting the terms and conditions of this license agreement use by non licensees is effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a copy of or access to a copy of any software without 1 accepting the license agreement through use and 2 triggering some licensee s obligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or access 3 qualified licensee requirement neither

accept this license agreement and prior to the time you elect to become a licensee and accept this license agreement you may always elect instead not to copy use modify distribute compile or perform the program or any software released under this license agreement however nothing else grants you permission to copy to obtain or possess a copy to compile a copy in object code or executable code from a copy in source code to modify or to distribute the program or any software based on the program these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license agreement additionally as set forth in section 2 any use copying or modification of the software constitutes acceptance of this license agreement by you 4 3 each time you redistribute the program or any software or derivative work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license agreement from the author to copy distribute modify perform or display the software subject to the terms and conditions of this license agreement you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license agreement enforcement is the responsibility of the author 5 grant of source code license 5 1 source code always available from author author hereby promises and agrees except to the extent prohibited by export control law to provide a machine readable copy of the source code of the program at the request of any licensee author reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine

continues to distribute the program and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the program every copy of the program distributed by hacktivismo but not necessarily every other author consists of the source code accompanied in some instances by an ancillary distribution of compiled object code but the continued availability of the source code from the author addresses the possibility that you might have for any reason not received from someone else a complete current copy of the source code lack of

any derivative work that includes any changes or modifications to any cryptographic techniques in the program shall employ strong cryptography 9 5 any program software or modification thereof copied or distributed by you if it contains any key generation or selection technique must not employ any substandard key selection technique 9 6 no program or software copied or distributed by you may transmit or communicate any symmetric key any private key if an asymmetric cryptosystem is employed or any part of such key nor may it otherwise make any such key or part of such key known to any person other than the end user who generated the key without the active consent and participation of that individual end user if a private or symmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner it must not be stored or recorded in plaintext and it must be protected from reading at a minimum by use of a password use of steganography or other techniques to disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is even stored is strongly encouraged but not absolutely required 10 use restrictions human rights violations prohibited 10 1 neither the program nor any software or derivative work based on the program may used by you for any of the following purposes 10 1 1 through 10 1 5 inclusive 10 1 1 to violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any person of human rights including without

10 1 and 10 2 inclusive 11 all export distributions must consist of or be ancillary to distribution of source code because of certain peculiarities of current export control law any distribution by you of the program or any software may be in the form of source code only or in the form or source code accompanied by compiled object code but you may not export any software in the form of compiled object code only such an export distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be ancillary to a distribution of the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed on a medium or by a method customarily used for software interchange 12 export laws this license agreement adds no restrictions to the export laws of your jurisdiction it is your responsibility to comply with any export regulations applicable in your jurisdiction from the united states canada or many countries in europe export or transmission of this software to certain embargoed destinations including but not necessarily limited to cuba iran iraq libya north korea sudan and syria may be prohibited if hacktivismo is identified as the author of the program and it is not the property of some other author then export to any national of cuba iran iraq libya north korea sudan or syria or into the territory of any of these countries by any licensee who has received this software directly from hacktivismo or from the cult of the dead cow or any of their members is contractually prohibited and will constitute a violation of this license agreement you are advised to consult the current laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to you before exporting this software to any destination special care should be taken to avoid export to any embargoed destination an author other than hacktivismo may substitute that author s legal name for hacktivismo in this paragraph in relation to any program released by that author under this paragraph 13 contrary judgments settlements and court orders if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license agreement they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license agreement if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license agreement and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the software at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license agreement would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program it is not the purpose of this section 13 to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the software distribution system reflected in this license agreement which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through related distribution systems in reliance on consistent application of such distribution systems it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice 14 governmental entities any governmental entity governmental entity is defined broadly as set forth in section 0 13 1 or governmental person as governmental person is defined broadly in section 0 13 2 that uses modifies

governmental entity that any doctrine or doctrines of law including without limitation any doctrine s of immunity or any formalities of contract formation may render this license agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable against such governmental entity or any governmental person of such governmental entity then prior to any use modification change display performance copy or distribution of the program or of any software or derivative work based on the program or any part thereof by the governmental entity or by any governmental person of that governmental entity the governmental entity shall be required to inform the author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed to render this license agreement or any part of it less than fully enforceable against such governmental entity or any governmental person of such entity and to explain in reasonable detail what additional steps if taken would render the license agreement fully enforceable against such entity or person failure to provide the required written notice to the author in advance of any such use modification change display performance copy or distribution shall constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all reliance on any doctrine by the governmental entity that is not included or that is omitted from the required written notice failure to provide any written notice means all reliance on any doctrine is irrevocably waived any governmental entity that provides written notice under this subsection is prohibited as are all of the governmental persons of such

each party is responsible for claims and damages arising directly or indirectly out of its utilization of rights under this license and you agree to work with initial developer original developer and contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability 13 multiple licensed code initial developer may designate portions of the covered code as multiple licensed multiple licensed means that the initial developer permits you to utilize portions of the covered code under your choice of the cpal or the alternative licenses if any specified by the initial developer in the file described in exhibit a 14 additional term attribution a as a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the original code “ original developer ” in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time money and effort invested in writing the original code the original developer may include in exhibit b “ attribution information ” a requirement that each time an executable and source code or a larger work is launched or initially run which includes initiating a session a prominent display of the original developer ’ s attribution information as defined below must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such covered code which may include display on a splash screen if any the size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the attribution information if the access by the end user to the executable and source code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the covered code this obligation shall not apply if the original code displays such attribution information in a particular form such as in the form of a splash screen notice at login an “ about ” display or dedicated attribution area on user interface screens continued use of such form for that attribution information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice b attribution information may only include a copyright notice a brief phrase graphic image and a url “ attribution information ” and is subject to the attribution limits as defined below for these purposes prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the original developer and that if you include attribution information or similar information for other parties you must ensure that the attribution information for the original developer shall be no less prominent than such attribution information or similar information for the other party for greater certainty the original developer may choose to specify in exhibit b below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable and source code resulting from the original code or any modification but not a larger work the intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution therefore the original developer can not require that you display at any time more than the following information as attribution information a a copyright notice including the name of the original developer b a word or one phrase not exceeding 10 words copyright one graphic image provided by the original developer and d a url collectively the “ attribution limits ” copyright if exhibit b does not include any attribution

otherwise permitted by law or as expressly set out in this license 15 additional term network use the term “ external deployment ” means the use distribution or communication of the original code or modifications in any way such that the original code or modifications may be used by anyone other than you whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network as an express condition for the grants of license hereunder you must treat any external deployment by you of the original code or modifications as a

"GPL-2.0+","gnu general public license version 2 june 1991 copyright copyright 1989 1991 free software foundation inc 51 franklin street fifth floor boston ma 02110 1301 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this general public license applies to most of the free software foundation s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it some other free software foundation software is covered by the gnu lesser general public license instead you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that you have you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with two steps 1 copyright the software and 2 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software also for each author s protection and ours we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software if the software is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations finally any free program is threatened constantly by software patents we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses in effect making the program proprietary to prevent this we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone s free use or not licensed at all the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0 this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this general public license the program below refers to any such program or work and a work based on the program means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification each licensee is addressed as you activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running the program is not restricted and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program independent of having been made by running the program whether that is true depends on what the program does 1 you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee 2 you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the program and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change b you must cause any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license c if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this license exception if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license 3 you may copy and distribute the program or a work based on it under section 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following a accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or b accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or c accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer in accord with subsection b above the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code 4 you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense or distribute the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance 5 you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the program or any work based on the program you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the program or works based on it 6 each time you redistribute the program or any work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license 7 if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license 8 if the distribution and or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license 9 the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of this license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation 10 if you wish to incorporate parts of

copyright 1989 1991 free software foundation inc 51 franklin street fifth floor boston ma 02110 1301 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document but changing it is not allowed preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it by contrast the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software to make sure the software is free for all its users this general public license applies to most of the free software foundation s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it some other free software foundation software is covered by the gnu lesser general public license instead you can apply it to your programs too when we speak of free software we are referring to freedom not price our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software and charge for this service if you wish that you receive source code or can get it if you want it that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs and that you know you can do these things to protect your rights we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it for example if you distribute copies of such a program whether gratis or for a fee you must give the recipients all the rights that you have you must make sure that they too receive or can get the source code and you must show them these terms so they know their rights we protect your rights with two steps 1 copyright the software and 2 offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy distribute and or modify the software also for each author s protection and ours we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software if the software is modified by someone else and passed on we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors reputations finally any free program is threatened constantly by software patents we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses in effect making the program proprietary to prevent this we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone s free use or not licensed at all the precise terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification follow terms and conditions for copying distribution and modification 0 this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this general public license the program below refers to any such program or work and a work based on the program means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law that is to say a work containing the program or a portion of it either verbatim or with modifications and or translated into another language hereinafter translation is included without limitation in the term modification each licensee is addressed as you activities other than copying distribution and modification are not covered by this license they are outside its scope the act of running the program is not restricted and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program independent of having been made by running the program whether that is true depends on what the program does 1 you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program s source code as you receive it in any medium provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee 2 you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it thus forming a work based on the program and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above provided that you also meet all of these conditions a you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change b you must cause any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license c if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run you must cause it when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty or else saying that you provide a warranty and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions and telling the user how to view a copy of this license exception if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves then this license and its terms do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you rather the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license 3 you may copy and distribute the program or a work based on it under section 2 in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following a accompany it with the complete corresponding machine readable source code which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or b accompany it with a written offer valid for at least three years to give any third party for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution a complete machine readable copy of the corresponding source code to be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange or c accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer in accord with subsection b above the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it for an executable work complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains plus any associated interface definition files plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable however as a special exception the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed in either source or binary form with the major components compiler kernel and so on of the operating system on which the executable runs unless that component itself accompanies the executable if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code 4 you may not copy modify sublicense or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license any attempt otherwise to copy modify sublicense or distribute the program is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this license however parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance 5 you are not required to accept this license since you have not signed it however nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license therefore by modifying or distributing the program or any work based on the program you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying distributing or modifying the program or works based on it 6 each time you redistribute the program or any work based on the program the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients exercise of the rights granted herein you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license 7 if as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason not limited to patent issues conditions are imposed on you whether by court order agreement or otherwise that contradict the conditions of this license they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license if you can not distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all for example if a patent license would not permit royalty free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system it is up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee can not impose that choice this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license 8 if the distribution and or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded in such case this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license 9 the free software foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the general public license from time to time such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns each version is given a distinguishing version number if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and any later version you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation if the program does not specify a version number of this license you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation 10 if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different write to the author to ask for permission for software which is copyrighted by the free software foundation write to the free software foundation we sometimes make exceptions for this our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally no warranty 11 because the program is licensed free of charge there is no warranty for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and or other parties provide the program as is without warranty of any kind either expressed or implied including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you should the program prove defective you assume the cost of all necessary servicing repair or correction 12 in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder or any other party who may modify and or redistribute the program as permitted above be liable to you for damages including any general special incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages end of terms and conditions how to apply these terms to your new programs if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms to do so attach the following notices to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notice is found one line to give the program s name and an idea of what it does copyright copyright yyyy name of author this program is free software you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the gnu general public license as published by the free software foundation either version 2 of the license or at your option any later version this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but without any warranty without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose see the gnu general public license for more details you should have received a copy of the gnu general public license along with this program if not write to the free software foundation inc 51 franklin street fifth floor boston ma 02110 1301 usa also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail if the program

warranty for details type show w this is free software and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions type show c for details the hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the general public license of course the commands you use may be called something other than show w and show c they could even be mouse clicks or menu items whatever suits your program you should also get your employer if you work as a programmer or your school if any to sign a copyright disclaimer for the program if necessary here is a sample alter the names yoyodyne inc hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program gnomovision which makes passes at compilers written by james hacker signature of ty coon 1 april 1989 ty coon president of vice this general public license does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs if your program is a subroutine library you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library if this is what you want to do use the gnu lesser general public license instead of this license"

"ODbL-1.0","odc open database license odbl preamble the open database license odbl is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share modify and use this database while maintaining this same freedom for others many databases are covered by copyright and therefore this document licenses these rights some jurisdictions mainly in the european union have specific rights that cover databases and so the odbl addresses these rights too finally the odbl is also an agreement in contract for users of this database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this database databases can contain a wide variety of types of content images audiovisual material and sounds all in the same database for example and so the odbl only governs the rights over the database and not the contents of the database individually licensors should use the odbl together with another license for the contents if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents if the contents have multiple sets of different rights licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply sometimes the contents of a database or the database itself can be covered by other rights not addressed here such as private contracts trade mark over the name or privacy rights data protection

utilisation of the whole or a substantial part of the contents into a new database is a derivative database and must comply with section 4 4 c derivative databases and produced works a derivative

a derivative database or this database as part of a collective database to create a produced work does not create a derivative database for purposes of section 4 4 and c use of a derivative database

"PDDL-1.0","open data commons public domain dedication license pddl preamble the open data commons � public domain dedication licence is a document intended to allow you to freely share modify and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions this licence is intended for use on databases or their contents data either together or individually many databases are covered by copyright some jurisdictions mainly in europe have specific special rights that cover databases called the sui generis database right both of these sets of rights as well as other legal rights used to protect databases and data can create uncertainty or practical difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a limited amount of rights under a some rights reserved approach to licensing as outlined in the science commons protocol for implementing open access data as a result this waiver and licence tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and data any community norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form a part of this document and do not act as a contract for access or other terms of use for the database or data the position of the recipient of the work because this document places the database and its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by this document recipients may use this work commercially use technical protection measures combine this data or database with other databases or data and share their changes and additions or keep them secret it is not a requirement that recipients provide further users with a copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of the data or database as a source the goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on the use of it by others the position of the dedicator of the work copyright law as with most other law under the banner of intellectual property is inherently national law this means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other ip rights can be relinquished waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world this is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection the internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights including copyright and database rights for use by the global community because of this feature of intellectual property law this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims it then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims the purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain unlike licences for free and open source software free cultural works or open content licences rightsholders will not be able to dual license their work by releasing the same work under different licences this is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose rightsholders therefore can ’ t re license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts this document can cover either or both of the database and its contents the data because databases can have a wide variety of content � not just factual data � rightsholders should use the open data commons � public domain dedication licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed under the terms of this document because even factual data can sometimes have intellectual property rights rightsholders should use this licence to cover both the database and its factual data when making material available under this document even if it is likely that the data would not be covered by copyright or database rights rightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a database and leave the contents to be covered by other licences or documents they can do this because this document refers to the work which can be either � or both � the database and its contents as a result rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document when they dedicate it just like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property rightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns please ensure that the rights have been cleared to make this material available under this document this document permanently and irrevocably makes the work available to the public for any use of any kind and it should not be used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen part i introduction the rightsholder the person holding rights or claims over the work agrees as follows 1 0

"Public-domain","public domain software is software that is not copyrighted if the source code is in the public domain that is a special case of noncopylefted free software which means that some copies or modified versions may not be free at all in some cases an executable program can be in the public domain but the source code is not available this is not free software because free software requires accessibility of source code meanwhile most free software is not in the public domain it is copyrighted and the copyright holders have legally given permission for everyone to use it in freedom using a free software license sometimes people use the term “ public domain ” in a loose fashion to mean “ free ” or “ available gratis ” however “ public domain ” is a legal term and means precisely “ not copyrighted ” for clarity we recommend using “ public domain ” for that meaning only and using other terms to convey the other meanings under the berne convention which most countries have signed anything written down is automatically copyrighted this includes programs therefore if you want a program you have written to be in the public domain you must take some legal steps to disclaim the copyright on it otherwise the program is copyrighted"
