in ani particular case base on the explan below when we speak of free softwar we are refer to freedom of use not price our gener public licens are design to make sure that you have the freedom to distribut copi of free softwar and charg for thi servic if you wish that you receiv sourc code or can get it if you want it that you can chang the softwar and use piec of it in new free program and that you are inform that you can do these thing to protect your right we need to make restrict that forbid distributor to deni you these right or to ask you to surrend these right these restrict translat to certain respons for you if you distribut copi of the librari or if you modifi it for exampl if you distribut copi of the librari whether grati or for a fee you must give the recipi all the

the free librari also if the librari is modifi by someon els and pass on the recipi should know that what they have is not the origin version so that the origin author s reput will not be affect by problem that might be introduc by other final softwar patent pose a constant threat to the exist of ani free program we wish to make sure that a compani can not effect restrict the user of a free

librari the combin of the two is legal speak a combin work a deriv of the origin librari the ordinari gener public licens therefor permit such link onli if the entir combin fit it criteria of freedom the lesser gener public licens permit more lax criteria for link other code with the librari we call thi licens the lesser gener public licens becaus it doe less to protect the user s freedom than the ordinari gener public licens it also provid other free softwar develop less of an advantag over compet non free program these disadvantag are the reason we use the ordinari gener public licens for mani librari howev the lesser licens provid advantag in certain special circumst for exampl on rare occas there may be a special need to encourag the widest possibl use of a certain librari so that it becom a de facto standard to achiev thi non free program must be allow to use the librari a more frequent case is that a free librari doe the same job as wide use non free librari in thi case there is littl to gain by limit the free librari to free softwar onli so we use the lesser gener public licens in other case permiss to use a particular librari in non free program enabl a greater number of

licens for librari did not effect promot softwar share becaus most develop did not use the librari we conclud that weaker condit might promot share better howev unrestrict link of non free program would depriv the user of those program of all benefit from the free statu of the librari themselv thi librari gener public licens is intend to permit develop of non free program to use free librari

that use the librari with the librari creat an execut that is a deriv of the librari becaus it contain portion of the librari rather than a work that use the librari the execut is therefor cover by thi licens section 6 state term for distribut of such execut when a work that use the librari use materi from a header file that is part of the librari the object code for the work may be a deriv work of the librari even though the sourc code is not whether thi is true is especi signific if the work can be link without the librari or if the work is itself a librari the threshold for thi to be true is not precis defin by law if such an object file use onli numer paramet data structur layout and accessor and small macro and small inlin function ten line or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestrict regardless of whether it is legal a deriv work execut contain thi object code plu portion of the librari will still fall under section 6 otherwis if the work is a deriv of the librari you may distribut the object code for the work under the term of section 6 ani execut contain that work also fall under section 6 whether or not they are link directli with the librari itself 6 as an except to the section abov you may also combin or link a work that use the librari with the librari to produc a work contain portion of the librari and distribut that work under term of

among them as well as a refer direct the user to the copi of thi licens also you must do one of these thing a accompani the work with the complet correspond machin readabl sourc code for the librari includ whatev chang were use in the work which must be distribut under section 1 and 2 abov and if the work is an execut link with the librari with the complet machin readabl work that use the librari

use at run time a copi of the librari alreadi present on the user s comput system rather than copi librari function into the execut and 2 will oper properli with a modifi version of the librari if the

that you distribut 7 you may place librari facil that are a work base on the librari side by side in a singl librari togeth with other librari facil not cover by thi licens and distribut such a combin librari provid that the separ distribut of the work base on the librari and of the other librari facil is otherwis permit and provid that you do these two thing a accompani the combin librari with a

everywher if you distribut copi of the softwar if you use it or if you modifi it in thi regard the methodolog we employ is not materi differ from the methodolog free softwar foundat employ in the gnu

object in both thi licens agreement and the gpl the term and condit that each license must accept are intend to discrimin against certain veri narrow limit kind of human endeavor that are inconsist

agreement enjoy veri broad latitud to chang use explor modifi and distribut the softwar much broader than they would enjoy with typic proprietari softwar packag as with copyleft licens such as the gpl

distribut those work have a correspond oblig to give back and not mere to take hessla licens code if you distribut copi of such an hessla licens program whether grati or for a fee you must give the

you must commun a copi of thi licens agreement to them as part of ani copi modif or re use of sourc or object code so they know their right and respons thu the main differ between thi licens agreement and the gpl is not the methodolog we employ fn15 but the scope and breadth of the polit object we seek to promot simpli put the polit object we promot are somewhat broader than the explicit polit goal that the free softwar foundat seek to promot through the gpl our goal includ a somewhat broader rang of human right than the specif copyright relat right with which the gpl is princip concern but while we are concern with the entir field of human right rather than a subset we want to make it perfectli clear that we also embrac share and seek to promot the goal we share with the free softwar movement fn15 there is a modest differ but it is not larg and mostli philosoph some expert on the gpl draw a distinct between a contract and a pure licens by take the posit that a pure licens doe not impos contractu condit on a license onli condit that would otherwis but for the licens be subsum within with exclus right that the licensor ha under copyright law thu the licensor ha the right to exclud anyon els from such activ as make copi make deriv work publicli perform a work and other exclus right specifi by statut but concern the act of use a comput softwar program in instanc in which a

exclus right to make copi a copi made from for exampl a comput hard drive to volatil memori in connect with the process of execut comput softwar so far as we can determin the free softwar foundat doe not argu that it is imposs contractu to impos condit on use as part of the bargain one strike when condit allow license to make copi of a program rather for philosoph reason the free softwar foundat voluntarili choos not to includ what it view as contractu condit in the gpl in thi sens hactivismo take the posit that the hessla is clearli a contract and contain contractu term such that it should not be consid a pure licens under the nomenclatur employ by the free softwar foundat howev in our view precis becaus both the hessla and the gpl are clearli condit grant of permiss to do thing from which the license would otherwis be exclud i e the license must undertak certain oblig in exchang for permiss to copi modifi or distribut a work the key point is that the methodolog is quit similar compar with the gpl aspect of the hessla give both end user and programm includ most importantli government end user and programm margin less leeway to make malici use of the program or to insert malici code into a program than they would have under a tradit copyleft softwar licens these aspect of the hessla such as the requir that the program can not be use to violat human right or forbid the insert of spi ware or surveil mechan into deriv work are includ becaus our ultim object is to preserv and promot the human right of end user includ their privaci and their right of free express in

a second copi creat as an essenti step in the util of the comput program in conjunct with a machin and that it is use in no other manner thi licens agreement presuppos that there is no exclus right to

to claim the abil to use copi distribut or modifi the program or ani softwar base on it without subject themselv voluntarili to it term on shrinkwrap click wrap use wrap and copi wrap licens agreement arguabl some kind of softwar licens agreement have more in common with legisl than they do with the bargain for negoti agreement that come to mind when most peopl think of contract particularli if a softwar licensor ha suffici market power to be deem a monopoli or if certain propos expans of the law of softwar licens masquerad as codif are wide adopt the abil of a privat entiti to impos legal prohibit and duti on virtual everyon els as though the licensor ha assum power that customarili belong to legisl bodi is both breathtak and deepli troubl of cours we are hardli the first to distribut softwar under a licens agreement that impos condit on a take it or leav it basi thi techniqu is as everyon know extrem common with proprietari softwar and some of the condit unilater impos by proprietari licensor rang from the ridicul to the obscen but even certain kind of free and open sourc softwar licens such as the gpl depend on the continu viabil of legal rule that enabl at least some reason condit to be impos by softwar licensor on a take it or leav it basi with essenti autom method of accept court have been divid as to how far these kind of licensor driven autom agreement can go and we can not say that we will be unhappi if court or legislatur ultim reach a consensu that sharpli limit what condit licensor can impos through such mechan howev while the law is still develop we think noth could be more appropri than to enlist the techniqu that institut of power have use to limit freedom and instead to re purpos the techniqu of copi wrap or use wrap licens by put them to use for humanitarian purpos and use them to promot the human right of end user to deni us the use of these techniqu court and other law make institut would be requir simultan to disarm to the same degre proprietari softwar manufactur that possess vast market power and unlik the condit impos by mani proprietari vendor the condit we impos through thi licens agreement are hardli oner for ani end user unless of cours the end user want to act malici or engag in surveil no warranti next for each author s protect and our own we want to make certain that everyon understand that there is no warranti for thi softwar and if the softwar is modifi by someon els and pass on we want it recipi to know that what they have is not the origin so that ani problem introduc by other will not reflect on the origin author reput softwar patent softwar patent constantli threaten ani project such as thi one we wish to avoid the danger that redistributor of a hessla licens program will individu obtain patent licens in effect make the program proprietari to prevent thi we have includ term by which ani author must if it ha patent or licens a patent cover ani technolog embodi in ani program or softwar releas under

a royalti free patent licens of ani patent technolog anyon can releas origin softwar under the hessla although thi licens agreement is draft with hacktivismo s object in mind perhap it will meet other author need as well if you are consid use thi licens agreement for your own softwar mean the code is not a work base on hacktivismo s program in which case all deriv work must be releas under thi licens agreement but rather your code is origin softwar that you have develop yourself and if you have no special reason to prefer thi licens agreement to some licens that ha a more robust and wide understood track record then in most instanc we encourag you to use the gpl or even better releas concurr under both the hessla and the gpl becaus a consider bodi of interpret literatur and commun custom ha grown up around that licens agreement the open softwar licens see http www rosenlaw com osl html is newer and ha less of a track record but you may also want to consid that licens option as well as the option of concurr osl hessla licens ani author of origin softwar can releas that softwar under thi licens agreement if you choos to do so not just hacktivismo hacktivismo is the author and owner of softwar releas by hacktivismo under thi licens agreement but origin softwar releas by other author would be own and licens by them ultim we think it is import to emphas to other author that program they have written can be releas under both the hessla and some other licens simultan for exampl a program that is present gpled by it author can be releas simultan under both the gpl and the hessla at the author s discret if you are an author of origin work you need neither the permiss of the free softwar foundat nor of hacktivismo to elect to releas softwar simultan under both licens the advantag of such a voluntari doubl licens is that it will enabl develop to produc hybrid softwar packag combin the function avail through say hacktivismo s six four api with some of the function of one or more popular gpl licens commun program and to releas the hybrid packag under the hessla without caus those develop to run afoul of the gpl the hessla or both such an arrang maxim the potenti benefit to both the develop commun and to end user worldwid softwar releas under a bsd style licens as a gener matter can be use to produc a hybrid program mix hessla licens code with code that wa previous subject to a bsd licens the hessla requir that in such an instanc the hybrid code must be releas under the hessla to avoid weaken the end user protect and affirm right afford by the hessla hacktivismo is more than happi to consult with ani softwar develop about the licens term that should appli to ani softwar that is deriv of ani program of which hacktivismo is author if anoth author ha
